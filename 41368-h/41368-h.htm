<p><i>Ownest love</i>,</p>

<p>Here is thy poor husband in a polar Paradise! I
know not how to interpret this aspect of Nature&mdash;whether
it be of good or evil omen to our enterprise.
But I reflect that the Plymouth pilgrims
arrived in the midst of storm and stept ashore upon
mountain snow-drifts; and nevertheless they prospered,
and became a great people&mdash;and doubtless
it will be the same with us. I laud my stars,
however, that thou wilt not have thy first impressions
of our future home from such a day as this.
Thou wouldst shiver all thy life afterwards, and
never realise that there could be bright skies, and
green hills and meadows, and trees heavy with
foliage, when now the whole scene is a great snow-bank,
and the sky full of snow likewise. Through
faith, I persist in believing that spring and summer
will come in their due season; but the unregenerated
man shivers within me, and suggests a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
doubt whether I may not have wandered within
the precincts of the Arctic circle, and chosen my
heritage among everlasting snows. Dearest, provide
thyself with a good stock of furs; and if thou
canst obtain the skin of a polar bear, thou wilt
find it a very suitable summer dress for this region.
Thou must not hope ever to walk abroad, except
upon snow-shoes, nor to find any warmth, save in
thy husband's heart.</p>

<p>Belovedest, I have not yet taken my first lesson
in agriculture, as thou mayst well suppose&mdash;except
that I went to see our cows foddered, yesterday
afternoon. We have eight of our own; and
the number is now increased by a transcendental
heifer, belonging to Miss Margaret Fuller. She
is very fractious, I believe, and apt to kick over
the milk pail. Thou knowest best, whether in
these traits of character, she resembles her mistress.
Thy husband intends to convert himself
into a milk-maid, this evening; but I pray heaven
that Mr. Ripley may be moved to assign him the
kindliest cow in the herd&mdash;otherwise he will perform
his duty with fear and trembling.</p>

<p>Ownest wife, I like my brethren in affliction
very well; and couldst thou see us sitting round
our table, at meal-times, before the great kitchen-fire,
thou wouldst call it a cheerful sight. Mrs.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
Parker is a most comfortable woman to behold;
she looks as if her ample person were stuffed full
of tenderness&mdash;indeed, as if she were all one great,
kind heart. Wert thou here, I should ask for
nothing more&mdash;not even for sunshine and summer
weather; for thou wouldst be both, to thy husband.
And how is that cough of thine, my belovedest?
Hast thou thought of me, in my perils
and wanderings? I trust that thou dost muse
upon me with hope and joy; not with repining.
Think that I am gone before, to prepare a home
for my Dove, and will return for her, all in good
time.</p>

<p>Thy husband has the best chamber in the house,
I believe; and though not quite so good as the
apartment I have left, it will do very well. I
have hung up thy two pictures; and they give me
a glimpse of summer and of thee. The vase I intended
to have brought in my arms, but could not
very conveniently do it yesterday; so that it still
remains at Mrs. Hillards's, together with my carpet.
I shall bring them [at] the next opportunity.</p>

<p>Now farewell, for the present, most beloved.
I have been writing this in my chamber; but the
fire is getting low, and the house is old and cold;
so that the warmth of my whole person has retreated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
to my heart, which burns with love for
thee. I must run down to the kitchen or parlor
hearth, when thy image shall sit beside me&mdash;yea,
be pressed to my breast. At bed-time, thou shalt
have a few lines more. Now I think of it, dearest,
wilt thou give Mrs. Ripley a copy of Grandfather's
Chair and Liberty Tree; she wants them
for some boys here. I have several copies of
Famous Old People.</p>

<p>April 14th. 10 A.M. Sweetest, I did not
milk the cows last night, because Mr. Ripley was
afraid to trust them to my hands, or me to their
horns&mdash;I know not which. But this morning, I
have done wonders. Before breakfast, I went out
to the barn, and began to chop hay for the cattle;
and with such "righteous vehemence" (as Mr.
Ripley says) did I labor, that in the space of ten
minutes, I broke the machine. Then I brought
wood and replenished the fires; and finally sat
down to breakfast and ate up a huge mound of
buckwheat cakes. After breakfast, Mr. Ripley put
a four-pronged instrument into my hands, which
he gave me to understand was called a pitch-fork;
and he and Mr. Farley being armed with similar
weapons, we all then commenced a gallant attack
upon a heap of manure. This office being concluded,
and thy husband having purified himself,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
he sits down to finish this letter to his most beloved
wife. Dearest, I will never consent that thou
come within half a mile of me, after such an encounter
as that of this morning. Pray Heaven
that his letter retain none of the fragrance with
which the writer was imbued. As for thy husband
himself, he is peculiarly partial to the odor;
but that whimsical little nose of thine might
chance to quarrel with it.</p>

<p>Belovedest, Miss Fuller's cow hooks the other
cows, and has made herself ruler of the herd, and
behaves in a very tyrannical manner. Sweetest,
I know not when I shall see thee; but I trust it
will not be longer than the end of next week. I
love thee! I love thee! I wouldst thou wert
with me; for then would my labor be joyful&mdash;and
even now it is not sorrowful. Dearest, I shall
make an excellent husbandman. I feel the original
Adam reviving within me.</p>

<i>Oak Hill</i>, April 16<sup>th</sup>, ½ past 6 A.M. [1841]</p>

<p>Most beloved, I have a few moments to spare
before breakfast; and perhaps thou wilt let me
spend them in talking to thee. Thy two letters
blessed me yesterday, having been brought by
some private messenger of Mrs. Ripley's. Very
joyful was I to hear from my Dove, and my heart
gave a mighty heave and swell. That cough of
thine&mdash;I do wish it would take its departure, for I
cannot bear to think of thy tender little frame being
shaken with it all night long.</p>

<p>Dearest, since I last wrote thee, there has been
an addition to our community of four gentlemen
in sables, who promise to be among our most useful
and respectable members. They arrived yesterday,
about noon. Mr. Ripley had proposed to
them to join us, no longer ago than that very
morning. I had some conversation with them in
the afternoon, and was glad to hear them express
much satisfaction with their new abode, and all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
the arrangements. They do not appear to be very
communicative, however&mdash;or perhaps it may be
merely an external reserve, like that of thy husband,
to shield their delicacy. Several of their
prominent characteristics, as well as their black attire,
lead me to believe that they are members of
the clerical profession; but I have not yet ascertained
from their own lips, what has been the nature
of their past lives. I trust to have much pleasure
in their society, and, sooner or later, that we
shall all of us derive great strength from our intercourse
with them. I cannot too highly applaud the
readiness with which these four gentlemen in black
have thrown aside all the fopperies and flummeries,
which have their origin in a false state of society.
When I last saw them, they looked as heroically
regardless of the stains and soils incident
to our profession, as thy husband did when he
emerged from the gold mine.</p>

<p>Ownest wife, thy husband has milked a cow!!!</p>

<p>Belovedest, the herd have rebelled against the
usurpation of Miss Fuller's cow; and whenever
they are turned out of the barn, she is compelled
to take refuge under our protection. So much did
she impede thy husband's labors, by keeping close
to him, that he found it necessary to give her two
or three gentle pats with a shovel; but still she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
preferred to trust herself to my tender mercies,
rather than venture among the horns of the herd.
She is not an amiable cow; but she has a very intelligent
face, and seems to be of a reflective cast
of character. I doubt not that she will soon perceive
the expediency of being on good terms with
the rest of the sisterhood. I have not been
twenty yards from our house and barn; but I begin
to perceive that this is a beautiful place. The
scenery is of a mild and placid character, with
nothing bold in its character; but I think its beauties
will grow upon us, and make us love it the
more, the longer we live here. There is a brook,
so near the house that we shall [be] able to hear it
ripple, in the summer evenings; but, for agricultural
purposes, it has been made to flow in a
straight and rectangular fashion, which does it infinite
damage, as a picturesque object.</p>

<p>Naughtiest, it was a moment or two before I
could think whom thou didst mean by Mr. Dismal
View. Why, he is one of the best of the brotherhood,
so far as cheerfulness goes; for, if he do not
laugh himself, he makes the rest of us laugh continually.
He is the quaintest and queerest personage
thou didst ever see&mdash;full of dry jokes, the
humor of which is so incorporated with the strange
twistifications of his physiognomy, that his sayings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
ought to be written down, accompanied with
illustrations by Cruikshank. Then he keeps quoting
innumerable scraps of Latin, and makes classical
allusions, while we are turning over the gold
mine; and the contrast between the nature of his
employment and the character of his thoughts is
irresistibly ludicrous.</p>

<p>Sweetest, I have written this epistle in the parlor,
while Farmer Ripley, and Farmer Farley, and
Farmer Dismal View, are talking about their agricultural
concerns, around the fire. So thou wilt
not wonder if it is not a classical piece of composition,
either in point of thought or expression. I
shall have just time before breakfast is ready&mdash;the
boy has just come to call us now&mdash;but still I
will tell thee that I love thee infinitely; and that I
long for thee unspeakably, but yet with a happy
longing. The rest of them have gone into the
breakfast room;...</p>

<p class="date">
<i>Brook Farm</i>, April 28<sup>th</sup>, 1841&mdash;7 A.M.</p>

<p>Mine ownest, what a beautiful bright morning
is this! I do trust that thou hast not suffered so
much from the late tremendous weather, as to be
unable now to go abroad in the sunshine. I tremble,
almost, to think how thy tender frame has
been shaken by that continual cough, which cannot
but have grown more inveterate throughout
these interminable ages of east wind. At times,
dearest, it has seemed an absolute necessity for me
to see thee and find out for a certain truth whether
thou wert well or ill. Even hadst thou been here,
thou wouldst have been penetrated to the core
with the chill blast. Then how must thou have
been afflicted, where it comes directly from the
sea.</p>

<p>Belovedest, thy husband was caught by a cold,
during his visit to Boston. It has not affected his
whole frame, but took entire possession of his
head, as being the weakest and most vulnerable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
part. Never didst thou hear anybody sneeze with
such vehemence and frequency; and his poor brain
has been in a thick fog&mdash;or rather, it seemed as if
his head were stuffed with coarse wool. I know
not when I have been so pestered before; and
sometimes I wanted to wrench off my head, and
give it a great kick, like a foot-ball. This annoyance
has made me endure the bad weather with
even less than ordinary patience; and my faith
was so far exhausted, that, when they told me yesterday
that the sun was setting clear, I would not
even turn my eyes towards the west. But, this
morning, I am made all over anew; and have no
greater remnant of my cold, than will serve as an
excuse for doing no work to-day. Dearest, do not
let Mrs. Ripley frighten thee with apocryphal
accounts of my indisposition. I have told thee
the whole truth. I do believe that she delights
to disquiet people with doubts and fears about
their closest friends; for, once or twice, she has
made thy cough a bugbear to thy husband. Nevertheless,
I will not judge too harshly of the good
lady, because I like her very well, in many respects.</p>

<p>The family has been dismal and dolorous,
throughout the storm. The night before last,
William Allen was stung by a wasp, on the eyelid;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
whereupon, the whole side of his face swelled
to an enormous magnitude; so that, at the breakfast
table, one half of him looked like a blind
giant (the eye being closed) and the other half
had such a sorrowful and ludicrous aspect, that
thy husband was constrained to laugh, out of sheer
pity. The same day, a colony of wasps was discovered
in thy husband's chamber, where they had
remained throughout the winter, and were now
just bestirring themselves, doubtless with the intention
of stinging me from head to foot. Thou
wilt readily believe, that not one of the accursed
crew escaped my righteous vengeance. A similar
discovery was made in Mr. Farley's room. In
short, we seem to have taken up our abode in a
wasps' nest. Thus thou seest, belovedest, that a
rural life is not one of unbroken quiet and serenity.</p>

<p>If the middle of the day prove warm and pleasant,
thy husband promises himself to take a walk,
in every step of which thou shalt be his companion.
Oh, how I long for thee to stay with me; in
reality, among the hills, and dales, and woods, of
our home. I have taken one walk, with Mr. Farley;
and I could not have believed that there was
such seclusion, at so short a distance from a great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
city. Many spots seem hardly to have been visited
for ages&mdash;not since John Eliot preached to
the Indians here. If we were to travel a thousand
miles, we could not escape the world more
completely than we can here.</p>

<p>Sweetest, I long unspeakably to see thee&mdash;it is
only the thought of thee that draws my spirit out
of this solitude. Otherwise, I care nothing for
the world nor its affairs. I read no newspapers,
and hardly remember who is President; and feel
as if I had no more concern with what other people
trouble themselves about, than if I dwelt in
another planet. But, still, thou drawest me to
thee continually; and so I can realise how a departed
spirit feels, while looking back from
another world to the beloved ones of this. All
other interests appear like shadows and trifles; but
love is a reality, which makes the spirit still an inhabitant
of the world which it has quitted.</p>

<p>Ownest wife, if Mr. Ripley comes into Boston
on Sunday, it is my purpose to accompany him.
Otherwise, thou mayst look for me some time during
the ensuing week. Be happy, dearest; and
above all, do shake off that tremendous cough.
Take great care of thyself, and never venture out
when there is the least breath of east-wind; but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
spread thy wings in the sunshine, and be joyous as
itself.</p>

<p>God bless thee.</p>

<p class="date"><i>Brook Farm</i>, May 4<sup>th</sup>, 1841. ½ past 1 P.M.</p>

<p>Belovedest, as Mr. Ripley is going to the city
this afternoon, I cannot but write a letter to thee,
though I have but little time; for the corn field
will need me very soon. My cold no longer troubles
me; and all this morning, I have been at work
under the clear blue sky, on a hill side. Sometimes
it almost seemed as if I were at work in the
sky itself; though the material in which I wrought
was the ore from our gold mine. Nevertheless,
there is nothing so unseemly and disagreeable in
this sort of toil, as thou wouldst think. It defiles
the hands, indeed, but not the soul. This gold ore
is a pure and wholesome substance; else our
Mother Nature would not devour it so readily,
and derive so much nourishment from it, and return
such a rich abundance of good grain and roots
in requital of it.</p>

<p>The farm is growing very beautiful now&mdash;not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
that we yet see anything of the pease or potatoes,
which we have planted; but the grass blushes
green on the slopes and hollows. I wrote that
word blush almost unconsciously; so we will let
it go as an inspired utterance. When I go forth
afield, I think of my Dove, and look beneath the
stone walls, where the verdure is richest, in hopes
that a little company of violets, or some solitary
bud, prophetic of the summer, may be there; to
which I should award the blissful fate of being
treasured for a time in thy bosom; for I doubt not,
dearest, that thou wouldst admit any flowers of
thy husband's gathering into that sweetest place.
But not a wild flower have I yet found. One of
the boys gathered some yellow cowslips, last Sunday;
but I am well content not to have found
them; for they are not precisely what I should like
to send my Dove, though they deserve honor and
praise, because they come to us when no others
will. We have our parlor here dressed in evergreen,
as at Christmas. That beautifullest little
flower vase of thine stands on Mr. Ripley's study
table, at which I am now writing. It contains
some daffodils and some willow blossoms. I
brought it here, rather than kept it in my chamber,
because I never sit there, and it gives me many
pleasant emotions to look round and be surprised
(for it is often a surprise, though I well know that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
it is there) by something which is connected with
the idea of thee.</p>

<p>Most dear wife, I cannot hope that thou art yet
entirely recovered from that terrible influenza;
but if thou art not almost well, I know not how
thy husband will endure it. And that cough too.
It is the only one of thy utterances, so far as I have
heard them, which I do not love. Wilt thou not
be very well, and very lightsome, at our next
meeting. I promise myself to be with thee next
Thursday, the day after tomorrow. It is an eternity
since we met; and I can nowise account for
my enduring this lengthened absence so well. I
do not believe that I could suffer it, if I were not
engaged in a righteous and heaven-blessed way of
life. When I was in the Custom-House, and then
at Salem, I was not half so patient; though my
love of thee has grown infinitely since then.</p>

<p>We had some tableaux last evening, the principal
characters being sustained by Mr. Farley and
Miss Ellen Slade. They went off very well. I
would like to see a tableaux arranged by my Dove.</p>

<p>Dearest, I fear it is time for thy clod-compelling
husband to take the field again. Good bye.</p>

<i>Brook Farm</i>, June 1<sup>st</sup>, 1841&mdash;nearly 6 A.M.</p>

<p><i>Very dearest</i>,</p>

<p>I have been too busy to write thee a long letter
by this opportunity; for I think this present life
of mine gives me an antipathy to pen and ink,
even more than my Custom-House experience did.
I could not live without the idea of thee, nor without
spiritual communion with thee; but, in the
midst of toil, or after a hard day's work in the
gold mine, my soul obstinately refuses to be
poured out on paper. That abominable gold mine!
Thank God, we anticipate getting rid of its treasures,
in the course of two or three days. Of all
hateful places, that is the worst; and I shall never
comfort myself for having spent so many days of
blessed sunshine there. It is my opinion, dearest,
that a man's soul may be buried and perish under
a dung-heap or in a furrow of the field, just as
well as under a pile of money. Well; that giant,
Mr. George Bradford, will probably be here to-day;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
so there will be no danger of thy husband
being under the necessity of laboring more than
he likes, hereafter. Meantime, my health is perfect,
and my spirits buoyant, even in the gold
mine.</p>

<p>And how art thou, belovedest? Two or three
centuries have passed since I saw thee; and then
thou wast pale and languid. Thou didst comfort
me in that little note of thine; but still I cannot
help longing to be informed of thy present welfare.
Thou art not a prudent little Dove, and
wast naughty to come on such a day as thou didst;
and it seems to me that Mrs. Ripley does not
know how to take care of thee at all. Art thou
quite well now?</p>

<p>Dearest wife, I intend to come and see thee
either on Thursday or Friday&mdash;perhaps my visit
may be deferred till Saturday, if the gold mine
should hold out so long. I yearn for thee unspeakably.
Good bye now; for the breakfast
horn has sounded, some time since. God bless
thee, ownest.</p>

<p>Oh, unutterably ownest wife, no pen can write
how I have longed for thee, or for any the slightest
word from thee; for thy Sunday's letter did not
reach me till noon of this very day! Never was
such a thirst of the spirit as I have felt. I began
to wonder whether my Dove did really exist, or
was only a vision; and canst thou imagine what a
desolate feeling that was. Oh, I need thee, my
wife, every day, and every hour, and every minute,
and every minutest particle of forever and
forever.</p>

<p>Belovedest, the robe reached me in due season,
and on Sabbath day, I put it on; and truly it imparted
such a noble and stately aspect to thy husband,
that thou couldst not possibly have known
him. He did really look tolerably personable!
and, moreover, he felt as if thou wert embracing
him, all the time that he was wrapt in the folds of
this precious robe. Hast thou made it of such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
immortal stuff as the robes of Bunyan's Pilgrim
were made of? else it would grieve my very heart
to subject it to the wear and tear of the world.</p>

<p>Belovedest, when dost thou mean to come
home? It is a whole eternity since I saw thee.
If thou art at home on a Sunday, I must and will
spend it with my ownest wife. Oh, how my heart
leaps at the thought.</p>

<p>God bless thee, thou belovedest woman-angel!
I cannot write a single word more; for I have
stolen the time to write this from the labors of the
field. I ought to be raking hay, like my brethren,
who will have to labor the longer and later, on
account of these few moments which I have given
to thee. Now that we are in the midst of haying,
we return to our toil, after an early supper. I
think I never felt so vigorous as now; but, oh, I
cannot be well without thee. Farewell,</p>

<p>Dearest unutterably, Mrs. Ripley is going to
Boston this morning, to Miss Slade's wedding; so
I sit down to write a word to thee, not knowing
whither to direct it. My heart searches for thee,
but wanders about vaguely, and is strangely dissatisfied.
Where art thou? I fear that thou
didst spend yesterday in the unmitigated east wind
of the seacoast. Perhaps thou art shivering, at
this moment.</p>

<p>Dearest, I would that I were with thee. It
seems as if all evil things had more power over
thee, when I am away. Then thou art exposed to
noxious winds, and to pestilence, and to death-like
weariness; and, moreover, nobody knows how to
take care of thee but thy husband. Everybody
else thinks it of importance that thou shouldst
paint and sculpture; but it would be no trouble to
me, if thou shouldst never touch clay or canvas
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
again. It is not what thou dost, but what thou
art, that I concern myself about. And if thy
mighty works are to be wrought only by the anguish
of thy head, and weariness of thy frame,
and sinking of thy heart, then do I never desire to
see another. And this should be the feeling of all
thy friends. Especially ought it to be thine, for
thy husband's sake.</p>

<p>Belovedest, I am very well, and not at all
weary; for yesterday's rain gave us a holyday; and
moreover the labors of the farm are not as pressing
as they have been. And&mdash;joyful thought!&mdash;in
a little more than a fortnight, thy husband will
be free from his bondage&mdash;free to think of his
Dove&mdash;free to enjoy Nature&mdash;free to think and
feel! I do think that a greater weight will then
be removed from me, than when Christian's burthen
fell off at the foot of the cross. Even my
Custom-House experience was not such a thraldom
and weariness; my mind and heart were freer.
Oh, belovedest, labor is the curse of the world,
and nobody can meddle with it, without becoming
proportionably brutified. Dost thou think it a
praiseworthy matter, that I have spent five golden
months in providing food for cows and horses?
Dearest, it is not so. Thank God, my soul is not
utterly buried under a dung-heap. I shall yet retain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
it, somewhat defiled, to be sure, but not utterly
unsusceptible of purification.</p>

<p>Farewell now, truest wife. It is time that this
letter were sealed. Love me; for I love thee infinitely,
and pray for thee, and rejoice in thee, and
am troubled for thee&mdash;for I know not where thou
art, nor how thou dost.</p>

<p>Belovedest, Mrs. Ripley met me at the door, as
I came home from work, and told me that Mary
was at Mrs. Park's, and that I might have an opportunity
to send a message to thee. Whether
thou hast written I do not know. At all events,
Mrs. Ripley has not yet given me the letter; nor
have I had a chance to ask her what she has heard
about thee; such a number of troublesome and intrusive
people are there in this thronged household
of ours. Dearest, if thou hast not written, thou
art very sick&mdash;one or the other is certain. That
wretched and foolish woman! Why could not
she have put the letter on my table, so that I
might have been greeted by it immediately on entering
my room? She is not fit to live.</p>

<p>Dearest, I am very well; only somewhat tired
with walking half a dozen miles immediately
after breakfast, and raking hay ever since. We
shall quite finish haying this week; and then there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
will be no more very hard or constant labor, during
the one other week that I shall remain a slave.
Most beloved, I received thy Lynn letter on Saturday,
and thy Boston letter yesterday. Then
thou didst aver that thou wast very well&mdash;but
thou didst not call thyself magnificent. Why art
thou not magnificent? In thy former letter, thou
sayest that thou hast not been so well for two
months past. Naughtiest wife, hast thou been
unwell for two months?</p>

<p>Ownest, since writing the above, I have been to
dinner; and still Mrs. Ripley has given no sign of
having a letter for me; nor was it possible for me
to ask her&mdash;nor do I know when I can see her
alone, to inquire about thee. Surely thou canst
not have let Mary come without a letter. And if
thou art sick, why did she come at all? Belovedest,
the best way is always to send thy letters by
the mail; and then I shall know where to find
them.</p>

<p>Aug. 17th&mdash;After breakfast.&mdash;Dearest, thou
didst not write&mdash;that seems very evident. I have
not, even yet, had an opportunity to ask Mrs. Ripley
about thee; for she was gone out last evening;
and when she came back, Miss Ripley and another
lady were with her. She mentioned, however,
that thy sister Mary looked very bright and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
happy; so I suppose thou couldst not be very intensely
and dangerously sick. I might have asked
Mrs. Ripley how thou didst, even in the presence
of those two women; but I have an inexpressible
and unconquerable reluctance to speak of thee to
almost anybody. It seems a sin. Well; I do not
feel so apprehensive about thy health as I did yesterday;
but, sweetest, if thou hadst sent some distinct
message, even though not a letter, it would
have saved thy husband some disquietude. Now
farewell for the present. I do long to see thee,
but know not how to get to thee. Dost thou love
me at all? It is a great while since thou hast told
me so.</p>

<p>Ownest wife, I meant to have finished this letter
this afternoon, and to have sent it by William
Allen in the morning; but I have just learnt that
Mr. Ripley is about to start for Boston; so I conclude
suddenly. God bless thee, and make thee
magnificent, and keep thee so forever and ever. I
love thee. I love thee.</p>

<i>Brook Farm</i>, Aug. 22<sup>nd</sup>, 1841</p>

<p>Most dear wife, it seems a long time since I
have written to thee. Dost thou love me at all?
I should have been reprehensible in not writing,
the last time Mr. and Mrs. Ripley went to town;
but I had an indispensable engagement in the
bean-field&mdash;whither, indeed, I was glad to betake
myself, in order to escape a parting scene with
poor Mr. Farley. He was quite out of his wits,
the night before, and thy husband sat up with him
till long past midnight. The farm is pleasanter
now that he is gone; for his unappeasable wretchedness
threw a gloom over everything. Since I
last wrote to thee, we have done haying; and the
remainder of my bondage will probably be light.
It will be a long time, however, before I shall
know how to make a good use of leisure, either as
regards enjoyment or literary occupation.</p>

<p>When am I to see thee again? The first of
September comes a week from Tuesday next; but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
I think I shall ante-date the month, and compel it
to begin on Sunday. Wilt thou consent? Then,
on Saturday afternoon, (for I will pray Mr. Ripley
to give me up so much time, for the sake of my
past diligence) I will come to thee, dearest wife,
and remain in the city till Monday evening.
Thence I shall go to Salem, and spend a week
there, longer or shorter according to the intensity
of the occasion for my presence. I do long to see
our mother and sisters; and I should not wonder if
they felt some slight desire to see me. I received
a letter from Louisa, a week or two since, scolding
me most pathetically for my long absence. Indeed,
I have been rather naughty in this respect;
but I knew that it would be unsatisfactory to
them and myself, if I came only for a single day&mdash;and
that has been the longest space that I could
command.</p>

<p>Dearest wife, it is extremely doubtful whether
Mr. Ripley will succeed in locating his community
on this farm. He can bring Mr. Ellis to no
terms; and the more they talk about the matter,
the farther they appear to be from a settlement.
Thou and I must form other plans for ourselves;
for I can see few or no signs that Providence purposes
to give us a home here. I am weary, weary,
thrice weary of waiting so many ages. Yet what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
can be done? Whatever may be thy husband's
gifts, he has not hitherto shown a single one that
may avail to gather gold. I confess that I have
strong hopes of good from this arrangement with
Munroe; but when I look at the scanty avails of
my past literary efforts, I do not feel authorized to
expect much from the future. Well; we shall
see. Other persons have bought large estates and
built splendid mansions with such little books as I
mean to write; so perhaps it is not unreasonable to
hope that mine may enable me to build a little cottage&mdash;or,
at least, to buy or hire one. But I am
becoming more and more convinced, that we must
not lean upon the community. Whatever is to be
done, must be done by thy husband's own individual
strength. Most beloved, I shall not remain
here through the winter, unless with an absolute
certainty that there will be a home ready for us in
the spring. Otherwise I shall return to Boston,&mdash;still,
however, considering myself an associate
of the community; so that we may take advantage
of any more favorable aspect of affairs. Dearest,
how much depends on these little books! Methinks,
if anything could draw out my whole
strength, it should be the motives that now press
upon me. Yet, after all, I must keep these considerations
out of my mind, because an external
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
purpose always disturbs, instead of assisting me.</p>

<p>Dearest, I have written the above in not so good
spirits as sometimes; but now that I have so ungenerously
thrown my despondency on thee, my
heart begins to throb more lightly. I doubt not
that God has great good in store for us; for He
would not have given us so much, unless He were
preparing to give a great deal more. I love thee!
Thou lovest me! What present bliss! What
sure and certain hope!</p>

<p>Most beloved,&mdash;Thou dost not expect a letter
from thy husband; and yet, perhaps, thou wilt not
be absolutely displeased should one come to thee
tomorrow. At all events, I feel moved to write;
though the haze and sleepiness, which always settles
upon me here, will certainly be perceptible in
every line. But what a letter didst thou write
to me! Thou lovest like a celestial being, (as
truly thou art,) and dost express thy love in heavenly
language;&mdash;it is like one angel writing to another
angel; but alas! the letter has miscarried,
and has been delivered to a most unworthy mortal.
Now wilt thou exclaim against thy husband's
naughtiness! And truly he is very naughty.
Well then; the letter was meant for him, and
could not possibly belong to any other being, mortal
or immortal. I will trust that thy idea of me
is truer than my own consciousness of myself.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span></p>

<p>Dearest, I have been out only once, in the day
time, since my arrival. How immediately and
irrecoverably (if thou didst not keep me out of
the abyss) should I relapse into the way of life in
which I spent my youth! If it were not for my
Dove, this present world would see no more of me
forever. The sunshine would never fall on me,
no more than on a ghost. Once in a while, people
might discern my figure gliding stealthily through
the dim evening&mdash;that would be all. I should be
only a shadow of the night; it is thou that givest
me reality, and makest all things real for me. If,
in the interval since I quitted this lonely old chamber,
I had found no woman (and thou wast the
only possible one) to impart reality and significance
to life, I should have come back hither ere
now, with the feeling that all was a dream and a
mockery. Dost thou rejoice that thou hast saved
me from such a fate? Yes; it is a miracle worthy
even of thee, to have converted a life of shadows
into the deepest truth, by thy magic touch.</p>

<p>Belovedest, I have not yet made acquaintance
with Miss Polly Metis. Mr. Foote was not in his
office when I called there; so that my introduction
to the erudite Polly was unavoidably deferred. I
went to the Athenaeum this forenoon, and turned
over a good many dusty books. When we dwell
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
together, I intend that my Dove shall do all the
reading that may be necessary, in the concoction
of my various histories; and she shall repeat the
substance of her researches to me. Thus will
knowledge fall upon me like heavenly dew.</p>

<p>Sweetest, it seems very long already since I saw
thee; but thou hast been all the time in my
thoughts; so that my being has been continuous.
Therefore, in one sense, it does not seem as if we
had parted at all. But really I should judge it to
be twenty years since I left Brook Farm; and I
take this to be one proof that my life there was an
unnatural and unsuitable, and therefore an unreal
one. It already looks like a dream behind me.
The real Me was never an associate of the community;
there has been a spectral Appearance
there, sounding the horn at day-break, and milking
the cows, and hoeing potatoes, and raking hay,
toiling and sweating in the sun, and doing me the
honor to assume my name. But be thou not deceived,
Dove, of my heart. This Spectre was not
thy husband. Nevertheless, it is somewhat remarkable
that thy husband's hands have, during
the past summer, grown very brown and rough;
insomuch that many people persist in believing
that he, after all, was the aforesaid spectral horn-sounder,
cow-milker, potatoe-hoer, and hay-raker.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
But such people do not know a reality from a
shadow.</p>

<p>Enough of nonsense. Belovedest, I know not
exactly how soon I shall return to the Farm. Perhaps
not sooner than a fortnight from tomorrow;
but, in that case. I shall pay thee an intermediate
visit of one day. Wilt thou expect me on Friday
or Saturday next, from ten to twelve o'clock on
each day,&mdash;not earlier nor later.</p>

<p><i>Ownest love,</i></p>

<p>In my last letter, I left it uncertain whether I
should come Friday or Saturday, because I deemed
it good to allow myself the freedom of choosing
the day that should be most vacant from all
earthly care and inconvenience, so that thou
mightest be sure to meet the whole of me; and,
likewise, I desired to have a brightest and sunniest
day, because our meetings have so often been in
clouds and drizzle. Also, I thought it well that thy
expectation of seeing thy husband should be diffused
over two days, so that the disappointment
might be lessened, if it were impossible for me to
come on the very day appointed. But these reasons
are of no moment, since thou so earnestly desirest
to know the day and hour. Unless the sky
fall, belovedest, I will come tomorrow. I know
of no obstacle; and if there were a million, it
would be no matter. When once we are together,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
our own world is round about us, and all things
else cease to exist.</p>

<p>Belovedest, thy letter of a week from Thursday
reached me not till Tuesday! It had got into the
hands of the penny-post. Farewell, ownest. I
love thee with infinite intensity, and think of thee
continually.</p>

<p>Most dear wife, thou canst not imagine how
strange it seems to me that thou shouldst ever suffer
any bodily harm. I cannot conceive of it&mdash;the
idea will not take the aspect of reality. Thou
art to me a spirit gliding about our familiar paths;
and I always feel as if thou wert beyond the reach
of mortal accident&mdash;nor am I convinced to the
contrary even by thy continual gashings of thy
dearest fingers and sprainings of thy ancle. I
love thee into the next state of existence, and
therefore do not realise that thou art here as subject
to corporeal harm as is thy husband himself&mdash;nay,
ten times more so, because thy earthly manifestation
is refined almost into spirit.</p>

<p>But, dearest, thy accident did make thy husband's
heart flutter very riotously. I wanted to
hold thee in mine arms; for I had a foolish notion
that thou wouldst be much better&mdash;perhaps quite
well! I cannot tell thee all I felt; and still I had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
not the horrible feelings that I should expect, because
there was a shadowiness interposed between
me and the fact, so that it did not strike my heart,
as the beam did thy head. Let me not speak of it
any more, lest it become too real.</p>

<p>Sweetest, thou dost please me much by criticising
thy husband's stories, and finding fault with
them. I do not very well recollect Monsieur de
Miroir; but as to Mrs. Bullfrog, I give her up to
thy severest reprehension. The story was written
as a mere experiment in that style; it did not
come from am depth within me&mdash;neither my
heart nor mind had anything to do with it. I recollect
that the Man of Adamant seemed a fine idea
to me, when I looked at it prophetically; but I
failed in giving shape and substance to the vision
which I saw. I don't think it can be very good.</p>

<p>Ownest wife, I cannot believe all these stories
about Munroe, because such an abominable rascal
never would be sustained and countenanced by
respectable men. I take him to be neither better
nor worse than the average of his tribe. However,
I intend to have all my copy-rights taken out
in my own name; and if he cheats me once, I will
have nothing more to do with him, but will
straightway be cheated by some other publisher&mdash;that
being, of course, the only alternative.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span></p>

<p>Dearest, what dost thou think of taking Governor
Shirley's young French wife as the subject
of one of the cuts. Thou shouldst represent her
in the great chair, perhaps with a dressing glass before
her, and arrayed in all manner of fantastic
finery, and with an outre French air; while the old
Governor is leaning fondly over her, and a Puritan
counsellor or two are manifesting their disgust,
in the background. A negro footman and
French waiting maid might be in attendance.
Do not think that I expect thee to adopt my foolish
fancies about these things. Whatever thou
mayst do, it will be better than I can think. In
Liberty Tree, thou mightest have a vignette, representing
the chair in a very battered, shattered,
and forlorn condition, after it had been ejected
from Hutchinson's house. This would serve to
impress the reader with the woeful vicissitudes of
sublunary things. Many other subjects would
thy husband suggest, but he is terribly afraid that
thou wouldst take one of them, instead of working
out thine own inspirations.</p>

<p>Belovedest, I long to see thee. Do be magnificently
well by Saturday&mdash;yet not on my account,
but thine own. Meantime, take care of thy dearest
head. Thou art not fit to be trusted away
from thy husband's guidance, one moment.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span></p>

<p>Dear little wife, didst thou ever behold such an
awful scribble as thy husband writes, since he became
a farmer? His chirography always was
abominable; but now it is outrageous.</p>

<p>God bless thee, dearest and may His hand be
continually outstretched over thy head. Expect
me on Saturday afternoon.</p>

<p>Ownest beloved, I know not whether thou dost

comfortable faith that it will not be altogether
unwelcome; so I boldly sit down to scribble. I
love thee transcendently; and nothing makes me
more sensible of the fact, than that I write thee
voluntary letters, without any external necessity.
It is as if intense love should make a dumb man
speak. (Alas! I hear a knocking at the door,
and suspect that some untimely person is about to
call me away from my Dove.)</p>

<p>Afternoon.&mdash;Dearest, it was even as I suspected.
How sad it is, that we cannot be sure of one
moment's uninterrupted communication, even
when we are talking together in that same old
chamber, where I have spent so many quiet years!
Well; thou must be content to lose some very
sweet outpourings wherewith my heart would
probably have covered the first, and perhaps
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
the second page of this sheet. The amount
of all would have been, that I am somewhat partial
to thee&mdash;and thou hast a suspicion of that
fact, already.</p>

<p>Belovedest, Master Cheever is a very good subject
for a sketch&mdash;especially if thou dost portray
him in the very act of executing judgment on an
evil-doer. The little urchin may be laid across
his knee, and his arms and legs (and whole person,
indeed) should be flying all abroad, in an agony
of nervous excitement and corporeal smart. The
Master, on the other hand, must be calm, rigid,
without anger or pity, the very personification of
that unmitigable law, whereby suffering follows
sin. Meantime, the lion's head should have a
sort of sly twist of one side of its mouth, and wink
of one eye, in order to give the impression, that,
after all, the crime and the punishment are neither
of them the most serious things in the world. I
would draw this sketch myself, if I had but the
use of thy magic fingers. Why dost thou&mdash;being
one and the same person with thy husband&mdash;unjustly
keep those delicate little instruments (thy
fingers, to wit) all to thyself?</p>

<p>Then, dearest, the Acadians will do very well
for the second sketch. Wilt thou represent them
as just landing on the wharf?&mdash;or as presenting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
themselves before Governor Shirley, seated in the
great chair? Another subject (if this do not altogether
suit thee) might be old Cotton Mather,
venerable in a three cornered hat and other antique
attire, walking the streets of Boston, and lifting
up his hands to bless the people, while they all revile
him. An old dame should be seen flinging or
emptying some vials of medicine on his head,
from the latticed window of an old-fashioned
house; and all around must be tokens of pestilence
and mourning&mdash;as a coffin borne along, a woman
or children weeping on a door-step. Canst thou
paint the tolling of the old South bell?</p>

<p>If thou likest not this subject, thou canst take
the military council, holden at Boston by the Earl
of Loudoun, and other captains and governors&mdash;his
lordship in the great chair, an old-fashioned
military figure, with a star on his breast. Some
of Louis XV's commanders will give thee the costume.
On the table and scattered about the room
must be symbols of warfare, swords, pistols,
plumed hats, a drum, trumpet, and rolled up banner,
in one heap. It were not amiss that thou introduce
the armed figure of an Indian chief, as
taking part in the council&mdash;or standing apart from
the English, erect and stern.</p>

<p>Now for Liberty tree&mdash;there is an engraving of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
that famous vegetable in Snow's History of Boston;
but thou wilt draw a better one out of thine
own head. If thou dost represent it, I see not
what scene can be beneath it, save poor Mr. Oliver
taking the oath. Thou must represent him with
a bag wig, ruffled sleeves, embroidered coat, and
all such ornaments, because he is the representative
of aristocracy and artificial system. The people
may be as rough and wild as thy sweetest
fancy can make them;&mdash;nevertheless, there must
be one or two grave, puritanical figures in the
midst. Such an one might sit in the great chair,
and be an emblem of that stern spirit, which
brought about the revolution. But thou wilt find
this is a hard subject.</p>

<p>But what a dolt is thy husband, thus to obtrude
his counsel in the place of thine own inspiration!
Belovedest, I want soon to tell thee how I love
thee. Thou must not expect me till Saturday
afternoon. I yearn infinitely to see thee. Heaven
bless thee forever and forever.</p>

<p class="date"><i>Brook Farm</i>, Sept. 22<sup>d</sup>, 1841&mdash;P.M.</p>

<p>Dearest love, here is thy husband again, slowly
adapting himself to the life of this queer community,
whence he seems to have been absent half
a life time&mdash;so utterly has he grown apart from
the spirit and manners of the place. Thou knowest
not how much I wanted thee, to give me a
home-feeling in the spot&mdash;to keep a feeling of
coldness and strangeness from creeping into my
heart and making me shiver. Nevertheless, I was
most kindly received; and the fields and woods
looked very pleasant, in the bright sunshine of the
day before yesterday. I had a friendlier disposition
towards the farm, now that I am no longer
obliged to toil in its stubborn furrows. Yesterday
and to-day, however, the weather has been intolerable&mdash;cold,
chill, sullen, so that it is impossible
to be on kindly terms with Mother Nature.
Would I were with thee, mine own warmest and
truest-hearted wife!</p>

<p>Belovedest, I doubt whether I shall succeed in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
writing another volume of Grandfather's Library,
while I remain at the farm. I have not the sense
of perfect seclusion, which has always been essential
to my power of producing anything. It is true,
nobody intrudes into my room; but still I cannot
be quiet. Nothing here is settled&mdash;everything
is but beginning to arrange itself&mdash;and though
thy husband would seem to have little to do with
aught beside his own thoughts, still he cannot but
partake of the ferment around him. My mind
will not be abstracted. I must observe, and think,
and feel, and content myself with catching
glimpses of things which may be wrought out
hereafter. Perhaps it will be quite as well that I
find myself unable to set seriously about literary
occupation for the present. It will be good to
have a longer interval between my labor of the
body and that of the mind. I shall work to the
better purpose, after the beginning of November.
Meantime, I shall see these people and their enterprise
under a new point of view, and perhaps be
able to determine whether thou and I have any
call to cast in our lot among them.</p>

<p>Sweetest, our letters have not yet been brought
from the Post Office; so that I have known nothing
of thee since our parting. Surely we were
very happy&mdash;and never had I so much peace and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
joy as in brooding over thine image, as thou wast
revealed to me in our last interview. I love thee
with all the heart I have&mdash;and more. Now farewell,
most dear. Mrs. Ripley is to be the bearer
of this letter; and I reserve the last page for tomorrow
morning. Perhaps I shall have a blessed
word from thee, ere then.</p>

<p>Septr. 23<sup>d</sup>&mdash;Before breakfast.&mdash;Sweetest wife,
thou hast not written to me. Nevertheless, I do
not conclude thee to be sick, but will believe that
thou hast been busy in creating Laura Bridgman.
What a faithful and attentive husband thou hast!
For once he has anticipated thee in writing.</p>

<p>Belovedest, I do wish the weather would put
off this sulky mood. Had it not been for the
warmth and brightness of Monday, when I arrived
here, I should have supposed that all sunshine
had left Brook Farm forever. I have no
disposition to take long walks, in such a state of
the sky; nor have I any buoyancy of spirit. Thy
husband is a very dull person, just at this time. I
suspect he wants thee. It is his purpose, I believe,
either to walk or ride to Boston, about the end of
next week, and give thee a kiss&mdash;after which he
will return quietly and contentedly to the farm.
Oh, what joy, when he will again see thee every
day!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span></p>

<p>We had some tableaux last night. They were
very stupid, (as, indeed, was the case with
all I have ever seen) but do not thou tell Mrs.
Ripley so. She is a good woman, and I like her
better than I did&mdash;her husband keeps his old place
in my judgment. Farewell, thou gentlest Dove&mdash;thou
perfectest woman&mdash;</p>

<p>Ownest Dove, it was but just now that I
thought of sending thee a few lines by Mr. Ripley;
for this penning of epistles is but a wretched
resource. What shall I do? What shall I do?
To talk to thee in this way does not bring thee
nearer; it only compels me to separate myself
from thee, and put thee at a distance. Of all
humbugs, pretending to alleviate mortal woes,
writing is the greatest.</p>

<p>Yet, thy two letters were a great comfort to me&mdash;so
great, that they could not possibly have been
dispensed with. Dearest, I did not write thee
what Mr. and Mrs. Ripley said to me, because
they have said nothing which I did not know before.
The ground, upon which I must judge of the
expediency of our abiding here, is not what they
may say, but what actually is, or is likely to be;
and of this I doubt whether either of them is capable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
of forming a correct opinion. Would that thou
couldst he here&mdash;or could have been here all summer&mdash;
in order to help me think what is to be done.
But one thing is certain&mdash;I cannot and will not
spend the winter here. The time would be absolutely
thrown away, so far as regards any literary
labor to be performed,&mdash;and then to suffer this
famished yearning for thee, all winter long! It
is impossible.</p>

<p>Dearest, do not thou wear thyself out with working
upon that bust. If it cause thee so much as a
single head-ache, I shall wish that Laura Bridgman
were at Jericho. Even if thou shouldst not feel
thyself wearied at the time, I fear that the whole
burthen of toil will fall upon thee when all is accomplished.
It is no matter if Laura should go
home without being sculptured&mdash;no matter if she
goes to her grave without it. I dread to have thee
feel an outward necessity for such a task; for this
intrusion of an outward necessity into labors of
the imagination and intellect is, to me, very painful.</p>

<p>Oh, what weather! It seems to me as if every
place were sunny, save Brook Farm. Nevertheless,
I had rather a pleasant walk to a distant
meadow, a day or two ago; and we found white
and purple grapes, in great abundance, ripe, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
gushing with rich juice when the hand pressed
their clusters. Didst thou know what treasures
of wild grapes there are in this land. If we dwell
here, we will make our own wine&mdash;of which, I
know, my Dove will want a great quantity.</p>

<p>Good bye, sweetest. If thou canst contrive to
send me a glimpse of sunshine, I will be the gratefullest
husband on earth. I love thee inextinguishably.
Thou hast no place to put all the love
which I feel for thee.</p>

<p><i>Dearest love,</i></p>

<p>Thy two letters of business came both together,
Saturday evening! What an acute and energetic
personage is my little Dove! I say it not in jest
(though with a smile) but in good earnest, and
with a comfortable purpose to commit all my
business transactions to thee, when we dwell together.
And why dost thou seem to apprehend
that thou mayst possibly offend me. Thou
canst do so never, but only make me love thee
more and more.</p>

<p>Now as to this affair with Munroe. I fully
confide in thy opinion that he intends to make an
unequal bargain with thy poor simple and innocent
husband&mdash;never having doubted this, myself.
But how is he to accomplish it? I am not, nor
shall be, in the least degree in his power; whereas,
he is, to a certain extent, in mine. He might announce
his projected library, with me for the editor,
in all the newspapers in the universe; but still
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
I could not be bound to become the editor, unless
by my own act; nor should I have the slightest
scruple in refusing to be so, at the last moment, if
he persisted in treating me with injustice. Then,
as for his printing Grandfather's Chair, I have the
copy-right in my own hands, and could and would
prevent the sale, or make him account to me for
the profits, in case of need. Meantime, he is making
arrangements for publishing this library, contracting
with other booksellers, and with printers
and engravers, and, with every step, making it
more difficult for himself to draw back. I, on the
other hand, do nothing which I should not do, if
the affair with Munroe were at an end; for if I
write a book, it will be just as available for some
other publisher as for him. My dearest, instead
of getting me within his power by this delay, he
has trusted to my ignorance and simplicity, and
has put <i>himself</i> in <i>my</i> power. Show the contrary,
if thou canst.</p>

<p>He is not insensible of this. At our last interview,
he himself introduced the subject of our bargain,
and appeared desirous to close it. But thy
husband was not prepared, among other reasons,
because I do not yet see what materials I shall
have for the republications in the library; the
works that he has shown me being all ill-adapted
for that purpose; and I wish first to see some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
French and German books, which he has sent for
to New York. And, belovedest, before concluding
the bargain, I have promised George Hillard
to consult him and let him do the business. Is
not this consummate discretion? And is not thy
husband perfectly safe? Then why does my
Dove put herself into a fever? Rather, let her
look at the matter with the same perfect composure
that I do, who see all around my own position,
and know that it is impregnable.</p>

<p>Most sweet wife, I cannot write thee any more
at present, as Mr. Ripley is going away instantaneously;
but we will talk at length on Saturday,
when God means to send me to thee. I love thee
infinitely, and admire thee beyond measure, and
trust thee in all things, and will never transact any
business without consulting thee&mdash;though on some
rare occasions, it may happen that I will have my
own way, after all. I feel inclined to break off
this engagement with Munroe; as thou advisest,
though not for precisely the reasons thou urgest;
but of this hereafter.</p>

<p>Ownest wife, I love thee most exceedingly&mdash;never
so much before; though I am sure I have
loved thee through a past eternity. How dost
thou do? Dost thou remember that, the day
after tomorrow, thou art to meet thy husband?
Does thy heart thrill at the thought?</p>

<p>Dearest love, thy husband was elected to two
high offices, last night&mdash;viz., to be a Trustee of
the Brook Farm estate, and Chairman of the Committee
of Finance!!!! Now dost thou not blush
to have formed so much lower an opinion of my
business talents, than is entertained by other discerning
people? From the nature of my office, I
shall have the chief direction of all the money affairs
of the community&mdash;the making of bargains&mdash;the
supervision of receipts and expenditures &amp;c.
&amp;c. &amp;c. Thou didst not think of this, when thou
didst pronounce me unfit to make a bargain with
that petty knave of a publisher. A prophet has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
no honor among those of his own kindred, nor a
financier in the judgment of his wife.</p>

<p>Belovedest, my accession to these august offices
does not at all decide the question of my remaining
here permanently. I told Mr. Ripley, that I
could not spend the winter at the farm, and that
it was quite uncertain whether I returned in the
spring.</p>

<p>Now, farewell, most dear and sweet wife. Of
course, thou canst not expect that a man in eminent
public station will have much time to devote
to correspondence with a Dove. I will remember
thee in the intervals of business, and love thee in
all my leisure moments. Will not this satisfy
thee?</p>

<p>God bless thee, mine ownest&mdash;my treasure&mdash;thou
gold and diamond of my soul!&mdash;my possession
forever&mdash;my enough and to spare, yet never,
never, to be spared! Sweetest, if it should be
very stormy on Saturday, expect me not&mdash;but the
first fair day thereafter.</p>

<p>Here is thy husband trying to write to thee,

But this dismal gloom! I positively cannot

<p>Dearest, I return the manuscript tale. It is
pretty enough; but I doubt whether it be particularly
suited to the American public; and, if intended
for publication, I trust it will undergo a
very severe revision. It will need it. I speak
frankly about this matter; but I should do the
same (only more frankly still) if the translation
were my Dove's own.</p>

<p class="date"><i>Brook Farm</i>, October 18<sup>th</sup>, Saturday [1841]</p>

<p>Most dear wife, I received thy letter and note,
last night, and was much gladdened by them; for
never has my soul so yearned for thee as now.
But, belovedest, my spirit is moved to talk
to thee to day about these magnetic miracles,
and to beseech thee to take no part
in them. I am unwilling that a power should
be exercised on thee, of which we know neither
the origin nor the consequence, and the phenomena
of which seem rather calculated to bewilder
us, than to teach us any truths about the
present or future state of being. If I possessed
such a power over thee, I should not dare to exercise
it; nor can I consent to its being exercised by
another. Supposing that this power arises from
the transfusion of one spirit into another, it
seems to me that the sacredness of an individual is
violated by it; there would be an intrusion into
thy holy of holies&mdash;and the intruder would not be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
thy husband! Canst thou think, without a
shrinking of thy soul, of any human being coming
into closer communion with thee than I may?&mdash;than
either nature or my own sense of right would
permit me? I cannot. And, dearest, thou must
remember, too, that thou art now a part of me,
and that, by surrendering thyself to the influence
of this magnetic lady, thou surrenderest more than
thine own moral and spiritual being&mdash;allowing
that the influence <i>is</i> a moral and spiritual one.
And, sweetest, I really do not like the idea of being
brought, through thy medium, into such an intimate
relation with Mrs. Park!</p>

<p>Now, ownest wife, I have no faith whatever
that people are raised to the seventh heaven, or to
any heaven at all, or that they gain any insight
into the mysteries of life beyond death, by means
of this strange science. Without distrusting that
the phenomena which thou tellest me of, and
others as remarkable, have really occurred, I think
that they are to be accounted for as the result of
a physical and material, not of a spiritual, influence.
<i>Opium</i> has produced many a brighter vision
of heaven (and just as susceptible of proof)
than those which thou recountest. They are
dreams, my love&mdash;and such dreams as thy sweetest
fancy, either waking or sleeping, could vastly improve
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
upon. And what delusion can be more lamentable
and mischievous, than to mistake the
physical and material for the spiritual? What so
miserable as to lose the soul's true, though hidden,
knowledge and consciousness of heaven, in the
mist of an earth-born vision? Thou shalt not do
this. If thou wouldst know what heaven is, before
thou comest thither hand in hand with thy
husband, then retire into the depths of thine own
spirit, and thou wilt find it there among holy
thoughts and feelings; but do not degrade high
Heaven and its inhabitants into any such symbols
and forms as those which Miss Larned describes&mdash;do
not let an earthly effluence from Mrs. Park's
corporeal system bewilder thee, and perhaps contaminate
something spiritual and sacred. I
should as soon think of seeking revelations of the
future state in the rottenness of the grave&mdash;where
so many do seek it.</p>

<p>Belovedest wife, I am sensible that these arguments
of mine may appear to have little real
weight; indeed, what I write does no sort of justice
to what I think. But I care the less for this,
because I know that my deep and earnest feeling
upon the subject will weigh more with thee than
all the arguments in the world. And thou wilt
know that the view which I take of this matter is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
caused by no want of faith in mysteries, but from
a deep reverence of the soul, and of the mysteries
which it knows within itself, but never transmits
to the earthly eye or ear. Keep thy imagination
sane&mdash;that is one of the truest conditions of communion
with Heaven.</p>

<p>Dearest, after these grave considerations, it
seems hardly worth while to submit a merely external
one; but as it occurs to me, I will write it.
I cannot think, without invincible repugnance, of
thy holy name being bruited abroad in connection
with these magnetic phenomena. Some (horrible
thought!) would pronounce my Dove an impostor;
the great majority would deem thee crazed;
and even the few believers would feel a sort of interest
in thee, which it would be anything but
pleasant to excite. And what adequate motive
can there be for exposing thyself to all this misconception?
Thou wilt say, perhaps, that thy
visions and experiences would never be known.
But Miss Larned's are known to all who choose to
listen.</p>

<p>October 19th. Monday.&mdash;Most beloved, what
a preachment have I made to thee! I love thee, I
love thee, I love thee, most infinitely. Love is
the true magnetism. What carest thou for any
other? Belovedest, it is probable that thou wilt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
see thy husband tomorrow. Art thou magnificent?
God bless thee. What a bright day is
here; but the woods are fading now. It is time I
were in the city, for the winter.</p>

my side;&mdash;there is no room for any more in the
whole universe.</p>

<p>Sweetest, I have nothing at all to say to thee&mdash;nothing,
I mean, that regards this external world;
and as to matters of the heart and soul, they are
not to be written about. What atrocious weather!
In all this month, we have not had a single truly
October day; it has been a real November month,
and of the most disagreeable kind. I came to this
place in one snowstorm, and shall probably leave
it in another; so that my reminiscences of Brook
Farm are like to be the coldest and dreariest imaginable.
But next month, thou, belovedest, will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
be my sunshine and my summer. No matter what
weather it may be then.</p>

<p>Dearest, good bye. Dost thou love me after
all? Art thou magnificently well? God bless
thee. Thou didst make me infinitely happiest, at
our last meeting. Was it a pleasant season likewise
to thee?</p>

<p><i>Dearest Soul,</i></p>

<p>I know not whether thou wilt have premonitions
of a letter from thy husband; but I feel absolutely
constrained to write thee a few lines this
morning, before I go up in town. I love thee&mdash;I
love thee&mdash;and I have no real existence but in
thee. Never before did my bosom so yearn for
the want of thee&mdash;so thrill at the thought of thee.
Thou art a mighty enchantress, my little
Dove, and hast quite subdued a strong man, who
deemed himself independent of all the world. I
am a captive under thy little foot, and look to thee
for life. Stoop down and kiss me&mdash;or I die!</p>

<p>Dearest, I am intolerably weary of this old
town; and I would that my visits might not be
oftener than once in ten years, instead of a fortnight.
Dost thou not think it really the most
hateful place in all the world? My mind becomes
heavy and nerveless, the moment I set my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
foot within its precincts. Nothing makes me wonder
more than that I found it possible to write all
my tales in this same region of sleepy-head and
stupidity. But I suppose the characteristics of the
place are reproduced in the tales; and that accounts
for the overpowering disposition to slumber
which so many people experience, in reading
thy husband's productions.</p>

<p>Belovedest, according to thy instructions, I have
been very careful in respect to mince-pies and
other Thanksgiving dainties; and so have passed
pretty well through the perils of the carnival season.
Thou art a dearest little wife, and I would
live on bread and water, to please thee, even if
such temperate regimen should produce no other
good. But truly thou art very wise in thy dietetic
rules; and it is well that I have such a wife to take
care of me; inasmuch as I am accustomed to eat
whatever is given me, with an appetite as indiscriminate,
though not quite so enormous, as that
of an ostrich. Setting aside fat pork, I refuse no
other Christian meat.</p>

<p>Dearest, I write of nothing; for I had nothing
to write when I began, save to make thee aware
that I loved thee infinitely; and now that thou
knowest it, there is no need of saying a word more.
On Monday evening, please God, I shall see thee.

<p>I would gladly go to Salem immediately if I
could, but I am detained here by some ceremonies,
which are needful to be gone through, previous to
my final deliverance from the Custom-House. As
Mr. Bancroft is not expected back from Washington
for some days, I shall probably remain till
nearly the close of next week. Meantime, I must
be near at hand, because my presence may be required

<p><i>Truest Heart,</i></p>

<p>Here is thy husband in his old chamber, where
he produced those stupendous works of fiction,
which have since impressed the Universe with
wonderment and awe! To this chamber, doubtless,
in all succeeding ages, pilgrims will come to
pay their tribute of reverence;&mdash;they will put off
their shoes at the threshold, for fear of desecrating
the tattered old carpet. "There," they will exclaim,
"is the very bed in which he slumbered, and
where he was visited by those ethereal visions,
which he afterward fixed forever in glowing
words! There is the wash-stand, at which this
exalted personage cleansed himself from the stains
of earth, and rendered his outward man a fitting
exponent of the pure soul within. There, in its
mahogany frame, is the dressing-glass, which reflected
that noble brow, those hyacinthine locks,
that mouth, bright with smiles, or tremulous with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
feeling, that flashing or melting eye, that&mdash;in
short, every item of the magnanimous phiz of this
unexampled man! There is the pine table&mdash;there
the old flag-bottomed chair&mdash;in which he sat, and
at which he scribbled, during his agonies of inspiration!
There is the old chest of drawers, in
which he kept what shirts a poor author may be
supposed to have possessed! There is the closet,
in which was reposited his threadbare suit of
black! There is the worn-out shoe-brush with
which this polished writer polished his boots.
There is&mdash;" but I believe this will be pretty much
all;&mdash;so here I close the catalogue.</p>

<p>Most dear, I love thee beyond all limits, and
write to thee because I cannot help it;&mdash;nevertheless,
writing grows more and more an inadequate
and unsatisfactory mode of revealing myself to
thee. I no longer think of saying anything deep,
because I feel that the deepest and truest must remain
unsaid. We have left expression&mdash;at least,
such expression as can be achieved with pen and
ink&mdash;far behind us. Even the spoken word has
long been inadequate. Looks are a better language;
but, bye-and-bye, our spirits will demand
some more adequate expression even than these.
And thus it will go on; until we shall be divested
of these earthly forms, which are at once our medium
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
of expression, and the impediments to full
communion. Then we shall melt into [one] another,
and all be expressed, once and continually,
without a word&mdash;without an effort.</p>

<p>Belovedest, my cold is very comfortable now.
Mrs. Hillard gave me some homo&mdash;I don't know
how to spell it&mdash;homeopathic medicine, of which
I took a dose last night; and shall not need another.
Art thou likewise well? Didst thou
weary thy poor little self to death, yesterday? I
do not think that I could possibly undergo the fatigue
and distraction of mind which thou dost.
Thou art ten times as powerful as I, because thou
art so much more ethereal.</p>

<p>Sweetest, thy husband has recently been both
lectured about and preached about, here in his
native city. The preacher was Rev. Mr. Fox of
Newburyport; but how he contrived to hook me
into a sermon, I know not. I trust he took for his
text that which was spoken of my namesake of
old&mdash;"Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom there
is no guile." Belovedest, if ever thou shouldst
happen to hear me lauded on any public occasion,
I shall expect thee to rise, and make thine own and
my acknowledgments, in a neat and appropriate
speech. Wilt thou not? Surely thou wilt&mdash;inasmuch
as I care little for applause, save as it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
shall please thee; so it is rather thy concern than
mine.</p>

<p>Mine ownest, it is by no means comfortable to
be separated from thee three whole days at a time.
It is too great a gap in life. There is no sunshine
in the days in which thou dost not shine on
me. And speaking of sunshine, what a beautifullest
day (to the outward eye, I mean) was yesterday;
and to-day seems equally bright and gladsome,
although I have not yet tasted the fresh air.
I trust that thou has flown abroad, and soared upward
to the seventh heaven. But do not stay
there, sweetest Dove! Come back for me; for I
shall never get there, unless by the aid of thy
wings.</p>

<p>Now God bless thee, and make thee happy and
joyful, until Saturday evening, when thou must

<p class="date"><i>Salem</i>, Feby. 27th, 1842&mdash;Forenoon</p>

<p><i>Thou dearest Heart,</i></p>

<p>As it is uncertain whether I shall return to Boston
tomorrow, I write thee a letter; for I need to
commune with thee; and even if I should bring the
scroll of my thoughts and feelings with me, perhaps
thou wilt not refuse to receive it. It is
awful, almost (and yet I would not have it otherwise,
for the world) to feel how necessary thou
hast become to my well-being, and how my spirit
is disturbed at a separation from thee, and
stretches itself out through the dimness and distance
to embrace its other self. Thou art my
quiet and satisfaction&mdash;not only my chiefest joy,
but the condition of all other enjoyments. When
thou art away, vague fears and misgivings sometimes
steal upon me; there are heart-quakes and
spirit-sinkings for no real cause, and which never
trouble me when thou art with me.</p>

<p>Belovedest, I have thought much of thy parting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
injunction to tell my mother and sisters that thou
art her daughter and their sister. I do not think
that thou canst estimate what a difficult task thou
didst propose to me&mdash;not that any awful and tremendous
effect would be produced by the disclosure;
but because of the strange reserve, in regard
to matters of feeling, that has always existed
among us. We are conscious of one another's
feelings, always; but there seems to be a tacit law,
that our deepest heart-concernments are not to be
spoken of. I cannot gush out in their presence&mdash;I
cannot take my heart in my hand, and show it to
them. There is a feeling within me (though I
know it is a foolish one) as if it would be as indecorous
to do so, as to display to them the naked
breast. And they are in the same state as myself.
None, I think, but delicate and sensitive persons
could have got into such a position; but doubtless
this incapacity of free communion, in the hour of
especial need, is meant by Providence as a retribution
for something wrong in our early intercourse.</p>

<p>Then it is so hard to speak of thee&mdash;<i>really</i> of
thee&mdash;to anybody! I doubt whether I ever have
<i>really</i> spoken of thee to any person. I have
spoken the name of Sophia, it is true; but the idea
in my mind was apart from thee&mdash;it embraced
nothing of thine inner and essential self; it was an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
outward and faintly-traced shadow that I summoned
up, to perform thy part, and which I
placed in the midst of thy circumstances; so that
thy sister Mary, or Mrs. Ripley, or even Margaret,
were deceived, and fancied that I was talking
about thee. But there didst thou lie, thy real self,
in my deepest, deepest heart, while far above, at
the surface, this distant image of thee was the
subject of talk. And it was not without an effort
which few are capable of making, that I could
ever do so much; and even then I felt as if it were
profane. Yet I spoke to persons from whom, if
from any, I might expect true sympathy in regard
to thee.</p>

<p>I tell thee these things, in order that my Dove,
into whose infinite depths the sunshine falls
continually, may perceive what a cloudy veil
stretches over the abyss of my nature. Thou wilt
not think that it is caprice or stubbornness that
has made me hitherto resist thy wishes. Neither.
I think, is it a love of secrecy and darkness. I am
glad to think that God sees through my heart;
and if any angel has power to penetrate into it, he
is welcome to know everything that is there. Yes;
and so may any mortal, who is capable of full
sympathy, and therefore worthy to come into my
depths. But he must find his own way there. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
can neither guide him nor enlighten him. It is
this involuntary reserve, I suppose, that has given
the objectivity to my writings. And when people
think that I am pouring myself out in a tale
or essay, I am merely telling what is common to
human nature, not what is peculiar to myself. I
sympathise with them&mdash;not they with me.</p>

<p>Feb. 28th&mdash;Forenoon.&mdash;Sweetest, thou shalt
have this letter instead of thy husband, to-night.
Dost thou love me? I shall not find any letter
from thee at the Post Office, because thou dost expect
to hear my footsteps on thy staircase, at six
o'clock this evening. Oh, but another day will
quickly pass; and then this yearning of the soul
will be appeased, for a little while at least. I
wonder, I wonder, I wonder, where on earth we
are to set up our tabernacle. God knows;&mdash;but I
want to know too.</p>

<p>Dearest love, I am very well, and comfortable
as I desire to be, in thy absence. After all, it is a
happiness to need thee, to sigh for thee, to feel the
nothingness of all things without thee. But do
not thou think so&mdash;thou must be happy always,
not independently of thy husband, but with a bliss
equally pervading presence and absence.</p>

<p>Belovedest, I have employed most of my time
here in collecting curiosities, and have so many on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
my hands that I begin to fear it will require a volume
to contain the catalogue. I would we had
such a museum in reality. And now good-bye,
most true Heart. Methinks this is the longest
letter that I have written thee for a great while.
Shalt thou expect me to write during my journey
to New York?&mdash;or, were it not better to allow
thee to forget me entirely, during that interval of
a week? God bless thee, thou unforgettablest

<p><i>My Dear,</i></p>

<p>It was thy husband's intention to spend all his
leisure time, here at home, in sketching out a tale;
but my spirit demands communion with thine so
earnestly, that I must needs write to thee, if all
the affairs in the world were pressing on me at
once. My breast is full of thee; thou art throbbing
throughout all my veins. Never, it seems to
me, did I know what love was, before. And yet I
am not satisfied to let that sentence pass; for it
would do wrong to the blissful and holy time that
we have already enjoyed together. But our
hearts are new-created for one another daily, and
they enter upon existence with such up-springing
rapture as if nothing had ever existed before&mdash;as
if, at this very <i>now</i>, the physical and spiritual
world were but first discovered, and by ourselves
only. This is Eternity&mdash;thus will every moment
of forever-and-ever be the first moment of life,
and no weariness can gather upon us from the
past.</p>

<p>It is a bliss which I never wish to enjoy, when I
can attain that of thy presence; but it is nevertheless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
a fact, that there is a bliss even in being absent
from thee. This yearning that disturbs my
very breath&mdash;this earnest stretching out of my
soul towards thee&mdash;this voice of my heart, calling
for thee out of its depths, and complaining that
thou art not instantly given to it&mdash;all these are a
joy; for they make me know how entirely our beings
have blended into one another. After all,
these pangs are but symptoms of the completeness
of our spiritual union&mdash;the effort of the outward
to respond to the inward. Dearest, I do not express
myself clearly on this matter; but what
need?&mdash;wilt not thou know better what I mean
than words could tell thee? Dost not thou too
rejoice in everything that gives thee a more vivid
consciousness that we are one?&mdash;even if it have
something like pain in it. The desire of my soul
is to know thee continually, and to know that thou
art mine; and absence, as well as presence, gives
me this knowledge&mdash;and as long as I have it, I
live. It is, indeed, impossible for us ever to be
really absent from one another; the only absence,
for those who love, is estrangement or forgetfulness&mdash;and
we can never know what those words
mean. Oh, dear me, my mind writes nonsense,
because it is an insufficient interpreter for my
heart.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span></p>

<p>... Most beloved, I am thinking at this moment
of thy dearest nose! Thou canst not know
how infinitely better I know and love Sophie
Hawthorne, since she has yielded up that fortress.
And, in requital, I yield my whole self up to her,
and kiss her beloved foot, and acknowledge her
for my queen and liege-lady forever more. Come
into my heart, dearest; for I am about to close my
letter. Hitherto, I have kept thee at arms'
length; because the very act of writing necessarily
supposes that thou art apart from me; but now I
throw down the pen, in order that thou mayst be
the closer to me.</p>

<p><i>Dearest Heart</i>,</p>

<p>Thy letter to my sisters was most beautiful&mdash;sweet,
gentle, and magnanimous; such as no angel
save my Dove, could have written. If they do not
love thee, it will be because they have no hearts
to love with;&mdash;and even if this were the case, I
should not despair of thy planting the seeds of
hearts in their bosoms. They will love thee, all
in good time, dearest; and we will be very happy.
I am so at this moment, while my breast heaves
with the consciousness of what a treasure God has
given me&mdash;in whom I see more to worship, and
admire, and love, every day of my life; and shall
see more and more as long as I live; else, it will be
because my own nature retrogrades, instead of advancing.
But thou wilt make me better and better,
till I am even worthy to be thy husband.</p>

<p>Oh, truest wife, what a long widowhood is this!
Three evenings without a glimpse of thee! And
I know not whether I am to come at six or seven
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
o'clock tomorrow evening&mdash;or scarcely, indeed,
whether I am to come at all. But, unless thou
orderest me to the contrary, I shall come at seven
o'clock.</p>

<p>I met Mr. Emerson at the Athenaeum yesterday.
He tells me that our garden, &amp;c., makes
fine progress. Would that we were there. God
bless us.</p>

<p><i>Dearest wife</i>,</p>

<p>I love thee beyond all hope of expression&mdash;so
do thou measure it by thine own love for me, if
indeed thou canst continue to love me, after our
parting. But never did I love thee better than
then; and I am even glad that this vapor of tobacco
smoke did, for once, roll thus darkly and
densely between us, because it helps me to hate the
practice forevermore. Thou wast very sweet not
to scold me fiercely, for allowing myself to be so
impregnated.</p>

<p>Sweetest, scarcely had I arrived here, when our
mother came out of her chamber, looking better
and more cheerful than I have seen her this some
time, and enquired about the health and well-being
of my Dove! Very kindly too. Then was
thy husband's heart much lightened; for I knew
that almost every agitating circumstance of her
life had hitherto cost her a fit of sickness; and I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
knew not but it might be so now. Foolish me, to
doubt that my mother's love would be wise, like
all other genuine love! And foolish again, to
have doubted my Dove's instinct&mdash;whom, henceforth&mdash;(if
never before)&mdash;I take for my unerring
guide and counsellor in all matters of the heart
and soul. Yet if, sometimes, I should perversely
follow mine own follies, do not thou be discouraged.
I shall always acknowledge thy superior
wisdom in the end; and, I trust, not too late for it
to exert its good influence. Now I am very happy&mdash;happier
than my naughtiness deserves. It
seems that our mother had seen how things were,
a long time ago. At first, her heart was troubled,
because she knew that much of outward as well
as inward fitness was requisite to secure thy foolish
husband's peace; but, gradually and quietly,
God has taught her that all is good; and so, thou
dearest wife, we shall have her fullest blessing
and concurrence. My sisters, too, begin to sympathise
as they ought; and all is well. God be
praised! I thank Him on my knees, and pray
him to make me worthy of thee, and of the happiness
thou bringest me.</p>

<p>Mine ownest, I long for thee, yet bear our separation
patiently, because time and space, and all
other finite obstructions, are so fast flitting away
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
from between us. We can already measure the
interval by days and hours. What bliss!&mdash;and
what awe is intermingled with it!&mdash;no fear nor
doubt, but a holy awe, as when an immortal spirit
is drawing near to the gate of Heaven. I cannot
tell what I feel; but thou knowest it all.</p>

<p>Sweetest, it is my purpose to remain here till
Friday, when, unless thou forbiddest me, I shall
be with thee at seven o'clock. God bless thee! I
have no more words, but a heart full of love.</p>

<p><i>True and Honorable Wife</i>,</p>

<p>Thou hast not been out of mind a moment since
I saw thee last,&mdash;and never wilt thou be, so long
as we exist. Canst thou say as much? Dearest,
dost thou know that there are but ten days more
in this blessed month of June? And dost thou
remember what is to happen within those ten days?
Poor little Dove! Now dost thou tremble, and
shrink back, and beginnest to fear that thou hast
acted too rashly in this matter. Now dost thou
say to thyself&mdash;"Oh, that I could prevail upon
this wretched person to allow me a month or two
longer to make up my mind; for, after all, he is
but an acquaintance of yesterday; and unwise am
I, to give up father, mother, and sisters, for the
sake of such a questionable stranger!" Ah, foolish
virgin! It is too late; nothing can part us
now; for God Himself hath ordained that we
shall be one. So nothing remains, but to reconcile
thyself to thy destiny. Year by year, thou
must come closer and closer to me; and a thousand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
ages hence, we shall be only in the honeymoon of
our marriage. Poor little Dove!</p>

<p>Sweetest wife, I cannot write to thee. The
time for that species of communion is past. Hereafter,
I cannot write my feelings, but only external
things, business, facts, details, matters which
do not relate to the heart and soul, but merely to
our earthly condition. I have long had such a
feeling, whenever I took up my pen&mdash;and now
more than ever.</p>

<p>Would that I knew when the priest is to thrust
himself between us! Dearest, the last day of the
month, if I mistake not, is Thursday, of next week.
Unless thou desirest my presence sooner, I shall
return to Boston probably on Sunday evening.
Then will the days lag heavily, till we can flee
away and be at rest. And, I pray thee, let our
flight be in the morning; for it would be strange
and wearisome to live half a day of ordinary life
at such an epoch. I should be like a body walking
about the city without a soul&mdash;being therein
the reverse of good old Dr. Harris, whose soul
walks about without the body. And this reminds
me, that he has not made himself visible of late.
Foolish me, not to have accosted him; for perhaps
he wished to give us some good advice on our entrance
into connubial life&mdash;or possibly, he intended
to disclose the hiding-place of some ancient
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
hoard of gold, which would have freed us forever
from all pecuniary cares. I think we shall not
need his counsel on the former point; but on the
latter, it would have been peculiarly acceptable.</p>

<p>Ownest, would there be anything amiss in exchanging
that copy of Southey's Poems for some
other book? We should still have Campbell's
English Poets as an immediate keepsake from
Miss Burley; and whatever book we might procure
would be none the less a gift from her. My
copy of Southey went to the Manse with my furniture;
else I should have brought it hither and
given it to Elizabeth&mdash;who, however, does not especially
admire Southey.</p>

<p>Now good bye, dearest love. I fear thou wilt
make thyself sick with much care and toil. God
bless thee! Our mother and sisters would send
their love, if they knew that I am writing to thee.
They love thee, and link us together in their
thoughts. God bless them, and us, and everybody.
Dost thou perceive how love widens my
heart?</p>

Dearest, thou knowest not how I have yearned for

so well and happy there, that I sent thee a letter,

whether thou hadst not better stay another week.
But thou hast done more wisely to come; for my

by surprise that I know not what to say upon the
subject; but my heart throbs mightily.</p>

<p>I have just arrived from Salem, and find thy
note, in which thou tellest me of thy illness. Oh,
my poor little Dove, thou dost need a husband
with a strong will to take care of thee; and when
I have the charge of thee, thou wilt find thyself
under much stricter discipline than ever before.
How couldst thou be so imprudent? Yet I will
not scold thee till thou art quite well. Then thou
must look for scoldings and chastisement too.</p>

<p>Belovedest, I shall not say a single word to induce
thee to go through the ceremony on Monday;&mdash;nay
I do not know that I will consent to its
taking place then. This we will determine upon
tomorrow evening. If thou art not very well indeed,

<p><i>Dearest Love</i>,</p>

<p>Thy sister Mary, after I left thee, told me that
it was her opinion that we should not be married
for a week longer. I had hoped, as thou knowest,
for an earlier day; but I cannot help feeling that
Mary is on the safe and reasonable side. Shouldst
thou feel that this postponement is advisable, thou
wilt find me patient beyond what thou thinkest
me capable of. I will even be happy, if thou wilt
only keep thy mind and heart in peace.</p>

<p>Belovedest, didst thou sleep well, last night?
My pillow was haunted with ghastly dreams, the
details whereof have flitted away like vapors, but
a strong impression remains about thy being magnetised.
God save me from any more such! I
awoke in an absolute quake. Dearest, I cannot
oppose thy submitting to so much of this influence
as will relieve thy headache; but, as thou lovest
me, do not suffer thyself to be put to sleep. My
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
feeling on this point is so strong, that it would be
wronging us both to conceal it from thee.</p>

<p>My ownest, if it will at all reconcile thee to the
ceremony, I will go to Concord, tomorrow or next
day, and see about our affairs there. I would
even go there and live alone, if thou didst bid me
though I shall be much happier in lingering here,
and visiting thy couch every evening, and hearing
thee say that thou art better than the night before.</p>

<p>What a sweet morning is this; it makes me feel
bright and hopeful, after the troubles of the
night.</p>

<p class="date"><i>Salem</i>, March 12<sup>th</sup> (Saturday), 1843</p>

<p>Own wifie, how dost thou do? I have been in
some anxiety about thy little head, and indeed
about the whole of thy little person. Art thou ill
at ease in any mode whatever? I trust that thy
dearest soul will not be quite worn out of thee,
with the activity and bustle of thy present whereabout,
so different from the intense quiet of our
home. That poor home! How desolate it is
now! Last night, being awake, my thoughts
travelled back to the lonely old house; and it
seemed as if I was wandering up stairs and down
stairs all by myself. My fancy was almost afraid
to be there, alone. I could see every object in a
sort of dim, gray light&mdash;our bed-chamber&mdash;the
study, all in confusion&mdash;the parlor, with the fragments
of that abortive breakfast on the table, and
the precious silver-forks, and the old bronze image
keeping its solitary stand upon the mantel-piece.
Then, methought, the wretched Pigwigger came
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
and jumped upon the window-sill, and clung there
with her forepaws, mewing dismally for admittance,
which I could not grant her, being there myself
only in the spirit. And then came the ghost
of the old Doctor stalking through the gallery, and
down the staircase, and peeping into the parlor;
and though I was wide awake, and conscious of
being so many miles from the spot, still it was
quite awful to think of the ghost having sole possession
of our home; for I could not quite separate
myself from it, after all. Somehow, the
Doctor and I seemed to be there tete-a-tete, and I
wanted thee to protect me. Why wast not thou
there in thought, at the same moment; and then
we should have been conscious of one another, and
have had no fear, and no desolate feeling. I believe
I did not have any fantasies about the
ghostly kitchen-maid; but I trust Mary left the
flat-irons within her reach; so that she may do all
the ironing while we are away, and never disturb
us more at midnight. I suppose she comes thither
to iron her shroud, and perhaps, likewise, to
smooth the doctor's band. Probably, during her
lifetime, she allowed the poor old gentleman to go
to some ordination or other grand clerical celebration
with rumpled linen, and ever since, and
throughout all earthly futurity (at least, so long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
us the house shall stand) she is doomed to exercise
a nightly toil, with spiritual flat-irons. Poor sinner&mdash;and
doubtless Satan heats the irons for her.
What nonsense is all this!&mdash;but really, it does
make me shiver to think of that poor house of ours.
Glad am I that thou art not there without thy husband.</p>

<p>I found our mother tolerably well; and Louisa,
I think, in especial good condition for her, and
Elizabeth comfortable, only not quite thawed.
They speak of thee and me with an evident sense
that we are very happy indeed, and I can see that
they are convinced of my having found the very
little wife that God meant for me. I obey thy injunctions,
as well as I can, in my deportment
towards them; and though mild and amiable manners
are foreign to my nature, still I get along
pretty well for a new beginner. In short, they
seem content with thy husband, and I am very certain
of their respect and affection for his wife.</p>

<p>Take care of thy little self, I tell thee! I praise
heaven for this snow and "slosh," because it will
prevent thee from scampering all about the city,
as otherwise thou wouldst infallibly have done.
Lie abed late&mdash;sleep during the day&mdash;go to bed
seasonably&mdash;refuse to see thy best friend, if either
flesh or spirit be sensible of the slightest repugnance&mdash;drive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
all trouble out of thy mind&mdash;and
above all things, think continually what an admirable
husband thou hast! So shalt thou have
quiet sleep and happy awaking; and when I fold
thee to my bosom again, thou wilt be such a round,
rosy, smiling little dove, that I shall feel as if I
had grasped all cheerfulness and sunshine within
the span of thy waist.</p>

<p>Dearest wife, Thy letters have all been received;
and I know not that I could have kept myself
alive without them; for never was my heart
so hungry and tired as it is now. I need thee continually
wherever I am, and nothing else makes
any approach towards satisfying me. Thou hast
the easier part&mdash;being drawn out of thyself by
society; but with me there is an ever-present yearning,
which nothing outward seems to have any influence
upon. Four whole days must still intervene
before we meet&mdash;it is too long&mdash;too long&mdash;we
have not so much time to spare out of eternity.</p>

<p>As for this Mr. Billings, I wish he would not be
so troublesome. I put a note for him into the
Boston Post-Office, directed according to his own
request. His scheme is well enough, and might
possibly become popular; but it has no peculiar
advantages with reference to myself; nor do the
subjects of his proposed books particularly suit my
fancy, as themes to write upon. Somebody else
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
will answer his purpose just as well; and I would
rather write books of my own imagining than be
hired to develope the ideas of an engraver; especially
as the pecuniary prospect is not better, nor so
good, as it might be elsewhere. I intend to adhere
to my former plan, of writing one or two mythological
story books, to be published under O'Sullivan's
auspices in New York&mdash;which is the only
place where books can be published, with a chance
of profit. As a matter of courtesy, I may perhaps
call on Mr. Billings, if I have time; but I do not
intend to be connected with this affair.</p>

<p>It is queer news that thou tellest me about the
Pioneer. I expected it to fail in due season, but
not quite so soon. Shouldst there be an opportunity
within a day or two, I wish thou wouldst
send for any letters that may be in the Post-Office
there; but not unless some person is going thither,
with intent to return before Wednesday next. If
thou receive any, keep them till we meet in Boston.</p>

<p>I dreamed the other night that our house was
broken open, and all our silver stolen. No matter
though it be:&mdash;we have steel forks and German
silver spoons in plenty, and I only wish that
we were to eat our dinner with them to-day. But
we shall have gained nothing on the score of snow,
and slosh, and mud, by our absence; for the bad
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
walking will be at its very <i>ne plus ultra</i>, next
week. Wouldst thou not like to stay just one
little fortnight longer in Boston, where the sidewalks
afford dry passage to thy little feet? It
will be mid-May, at least, ere thou wilt find even
tolerable walking in Concord. So if thou wishest
to walk while thou canst, we will put off our return
a week longer. Naughty husband that I am!
I know by my own heart that thou pinest for our
home, and for the bosom where thou belongest.
A week longer! It is a horrible thought.</p>

<p>We cannot very well afford to buy a surplus
stock of paper, just now. By and by, I should
like some, and I suppose there will always be opportunities
to get it cheap at auction. I do wonder&mdash;and
always shall wonder, until the matter
be reformed&mdash;why Providence keeps us so short of
cash. Our earnings are miserably scanty at best;
yet, if we could but get even that pittance, I
should continue to be thankful, though certainly
for small favors. The world deserves to come to
a speedy end, if it were for nothing else save to
break down the abominable system of credit&mdash;of
keeping possession of other people's property&mdash;which
renders it impossible for a man to be just
and honest, even if so inclined. It is almost a
pity that the comet is retrograding from the earth;
it might do away with all our perversities at one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
smash. And thou, my little dove, and thy husband
for thy sake, might be pretty certain of a
removal to some sphere where we should have all
our present happiness, and none of these earthly
inconveniences.</p>

<p>Ah, but, for the present, I like this earth better
than Paradise itself. I love thee, thou dearest.
It is only when away from thee, that the chill
winds of the world make me shiver. Thou always
keepest me warm, and always wilt; and
without thee, I should shiver in Heaven. Dearest,
I think I prefer to write thy name "Mrs. Sophia
A. Hawthorne," rather than "Mrs. Nathaniel
Hawthorne";&mdash;the latter gives me an image of
myself in petticoats, knitting a stocking. I feel
so sensibly that thou art my chastest, holiest wife&mdash;a
<i>woman</i> and an angel. But thou dost not love
to blush in the midst of people.</p>

<p>Ownest, expect me next Tuesday in the forenoon;
and do not look for another letter. I pray
heaven that I may find thee well, and not tired
quite to death. Even shouldst thou be so, however,
I will restore thee on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Thy letter came this morning&mdash;much needed;
for I was feeling desolate and fragmentary. Thou
shouldst not ask me to come to Boston, because I
can hardly resist setting off this minute&mdash;and I
have no right to spend money for such luxuries. I
think I shall stay here until Bridge reaches Boston;
for he wishes to see me then; and, if he could
meet thee, and baby, and me, it would save him
and us the trouble and perplexity of a visit at
Concord. He will probably be in Boston in not
much more or less than a week; and I have written
to him to call at 13, West St. When he arrives,
let him be told to send for me forthwith, or do
thou write thyself; and I will immediately make
my appearance. Sweetest wife, it goes against
my conscience to add another inhabitant to the
immense multitude in thy mother's caravanserai;
nevertheless, methinks I may come there for one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
night, and, if I stay longer, remove thence to
George Hillard's. But I don't know. I should
like to spend two or three days in Boston, if it
could be done without any derangement of other
people or myself; but I should not feel easy in the
caravanserai. Perhaps it would be better to go at
once to George Hillard's. After we get home, we
will rest one another from all toils.</p>

<p>I am very well, dearest, and it seems to me that
I am recovering some of the flesh that I lost, during
our long Lent. I do not eat quite enough to
satisfy mother and Louisa; but thou wouldst be
perfectly satisfied, and so am I. My spirits are
pretty equable, though there is a great vacuity
caused by thy absence out of my daily life&mdash;a bottomless
abyss, into which all minor contentments
might be flung without filling it up. Still, I feel
as if our separation were only apparent&mdash;at all
events, we are at less than an hour's distance from
one another, and therefore may find it easier to
spend a week apart. The good that I get by remaining
here, is a temporary freedom from that
vile burthen which had irked and chafed me so
long&mdash;that consciousness of debt, and pecuniary
botheration, and the difficulty of providing even
for the day's wants. This trouble does not pursue
me here; and even when we go back, I hope
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
not to feel it nearly so much as before. Polk's
election has certainly brightened our prospects;
and we have a right to expect that our difficulties
will vanish, in the course of a few months.</p>

<p>I long to see our little Una; but she is not yet a
vital portion of my being. I find that her idea
merges in thine. I wish for thee; and our daughter
is included in that wish, without being particularly
expressed. She has quite conquered the
heart of our mother and sisters; and I am glad of
it, for now they can transfer their interest from
their own sombre lives to her happy one; and so be
blest through her. To confess the truth, she is a
dear little thing.</p>

<p>Sweetest Phoebe: I don't intend to stay here
more than a week, even if Bridge should not arrive;&mdash;and
should there be any reason for our returning
to Concord sooner, thou canst let me know.
Otherwise, I purpose to come to Boston in a week
from to-day or tomorrow,&mdash;to spend two or three
days there&mdash;and then go back to the old Abbey; of
which there is a very dismal picture at present in
my imagination, cold, lonely, and desolate, with
untrodden snow along the avenue, and on the
doorsteps. But its heart will be warm, when we
are within. If thou shalt want me sooner, write,&mdash;if
not so soon, write.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span></p>

<p>God bless thee, mine ownest. I must close the
letter now, because it is dinner-time; and I shall
take it to the Post-Office immediately after dinner.
I spend almost all my afternoons at the
Athenaeum. Kiss our child for me&mdash;one kiss for
thyself and me together. I love her, and live in
thee.</p>

<p><i>Darlingest Phoebe</i>,</p>

<p>I knew that a letter must come to-day; and it
cheered and satisfied me, as mine did thee. How
we love one another! Blessed we! What a blot
I have made of that word "blessed"! But the
consciousness of bliss is as clear as crystal in my
heart, though now and then, in great stress of
earthly perplexities, a mist bedims its surface.</p>

<p>Belovedest, it will not be anywise necessary for
thee to see Bridge at all, before I come,&mdash;nor then
either, if thou preferrest meeting him in Concord.
If I find him resolved to go to Concord, at any
rate, I shall not bring him to see thee in Boston;
because, as a lady ought, thou appearest to best
advantage in thine own house. I merely asked
him to call at 13 West-street to learn my whereabout&mdash;not
to be introduced to thee. Indeed; I
should prefer thy not seeing him till I come. It
was his purpose to be in Boston before this time;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
but probably he has remained in Washington to
see the opening of Congress, and perhaps to try
whether he can help forward our official enterprises.
Unless he arrive sooner, I purpose to remain
here till Wednesday, and to leave on the
evening of that day.</p>

<p>I have not yet called on the Pickmen or the
Feet, but solemnly purpose so to do, before I
leave Salem.</p>

<p>Mr. Upham, it is said, has resigned his pastorship.
When he returned from Concord, he told
the most pitiable stories about our poverty and
misery; so as almost to make it appear that we
were suffering for food. Everybody that speaks to
me seems tacitly to take it for granted that we are
in a very desperate condition, and that a government
office is the only alternative of the almshouse.
I care not for the reputation of being
wealthier than I am; but we never have been quite
paupers, and need not have been represented as
such.</p>

<p>Now good-bye, mine ownest little wife! I
thank God above all things that thou art my wife&mdash;next
that Una is our child. I shall come back
to thee with tenfold as much love as ever I felt
before. Nobody but we ever knew what it is to
be married. We alone know the bliss and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
mystery; if other people knew it, this dull old
earth would have a perpetual glow round about it.</p>

<p><i>Sweetest Phoebe</i>,</p>

<p>It will be a week tomorrow since I left thee; and
in all that time, I have heard nothing of thee, nor
thou of me. Nevertheless, I am not anxious, because
I know thou wouldst write to me at once,
were anything amiss. But truly my heart is not
a little hungry and thirsty for thee; so, of my own
accord, or rather of my own necessity, I sit down
to write thee a word or two. First of all, I love
thee. Also, I love our little Una&mdash;and, I think,
with a much more adequate comprehension of her
loveliness, than before we left Concord. She is
partly worthy of being thy daughter;&mdash;if not
wholly to, it must be her father's fault.</p>

<p>Mine own, I know not what to say to thee. I
feel now as when we clasp one another in our
arms, and are silent.</p>

<p>Our mother and sisters were rejoiced to see me,
and not altogether surprised; for they seem to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
have had a kind of presentiment of my return.
Mother had wished Louisa to write for us both to
come back; but I think it would not be wise to
bring Una here again, till warm weather. I am
not without apprehensions that she will have
grown too tender to bear the atmosphere of our
cold and windy old Abbey in Concord, after becoming
acclimated to the milder temperature of
thy father's house. However, we will trust to
Providence, and likewise to a good fire in our
guest-chamber. Thou wilt write to me when all
things are propitious for our return. They wish
me to stay here till after Christmas;&mdash;which I
think is next Wednesday&mdash;but I care little about
festivals. My only festival is when I have thee.
But I suppose we shall not get home before the
last of next week;&mdash;it will not do to delay our return
much longer than that, else we shall be said
to have run away from our creditors.</p>

<p>If I had not known it before, I should have been
taught by this long separation, that the only real
life is to be with thee&mdash;to be thy husband&mdash;thy
intimatest, thy lovingest, thy belovedest&mdash;and to
share all things, good or evil, with thee. The
days and weeks that I have spent away from thee
are unsubstantial&mdash;there is nothing in them&mdash;and
yet they have done me good, in making me more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
conscious of this truth. Now that I stand a little
apart from our Concord life, the troubles and incommodities
look slighter&mdash;our happiness more
vast and inestimable. I trust Heaven will not
permit us to be greatly pinched by poverty, during
the remainder of our stay there. It would be
a pity to have our recollection of this first home
darkened by such associations,&mdash;the home where
our love first assumed human life in the form of
our darling child.</p>

<p>I hear nothing yet from O'Sullivan&mdash;nor from
Bridge. I am afraid the latter gentleman must
be ill; else, methinks, he would certainly have
written; for he has always been a punctual correspondent,
when there was anything to write about.</p>

<p>Ownest Dove, I think I shall not go back to
Hillard's. I shall be ready to go back to Concord
whenever thou art; but, not having the opportunity
to consult thee, I now propose that we settle
our return for Saturday, a week from tomorrow.
Should anything prevent thee from going then
(for instance, the want of a girl) I may go and
pay our debts, as far as in my power, and then return.
But this need not be anticipated. There
is no absolute necessity&mdash;(except in our hearts,
which cannot endure to be away from one another
much longer)&mdash;for our being at home before the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
first of January; but if all things are convenient,
we will not delay longer than Saturday. Oh,
what sweet, sweet times we will have.</p>

<p>Give Una a kiss, and her father's blessing.
She is very famous here in Salem.</p>

<p><i>Ownest Phoebe</i>,</p>

<p>Thy letter reached me yesterday forenoon, and
made me truly happy&mdash;happier than I can tell. I
do not think that I am the more conscious of the
baby, by standing aloof from her. She has not
yet sufficiently realised herself in my soul; it
seems like a dream, therefore, which needs such assurances
as thy letter, to convince me that it is
more than a dream. Well; I cannot write about
her&mdash;nor about thee, belovedest, for whom I have
at this moment an unutterable yearning. Methinks
my hand was never so out of keeping with
my heart.</p>

<p>I called at the book room in Boston, and saw
there thy mother, thy brother Nat, and Elizabeth!!&mdash;besides
two or three ladies. It was the
most awkward place in the world to talk about
Una and other kindred subjects; so I made my escape
as soon as possible, promising to return to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
dine if convenient, and resolving that it should be
as inconvenient as possible. I wish thy mother
could be so inhospitable as never to ask me&mdash;but
at all events, I need never go, except when thou
art there. I went to George Hillard's office, and
he spoke with unmitigable resolution of the necessity
of my going to dine with Longfellow before
returning to Concord; but I have an almost miraculous
power of escaping from necessities of this
kind. Destiny itself has often been worsted in
the attempt to get me out to dinner. Possibly,
however, I may go. Afterwards I called on Colonel
Hall, who held me long in talk about politics
and other sweetmeats. Here, likewise, I refused
one or two invitations to dinner. Then I stept
into a book-auction, not to buy, but merely to observe;
and after a few moments, who should come
in, with a smile as sweet as sugar (though savoring
rather of molasses) but, to my horror and petrifaction,
Mr. Watterson! I anticipated a great
deal of bore and botheration; but, through Heaven's
mercy, he merely spoke a few words, and then
left me. This is so unlike his deportment in
times past, that I suspect the Celestial Railroad
must have given him a pique; and if so, I shall
feel as if Providence had sufficiently rewarded me
for that pious labor.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span></p>

<p>In the course of the forenoon, I encountered Mr.
Howes in the street. He looked most exceedingly
depressed, and pressing my hand with peculiar
emphasis, said that he was in great affliction, having
just had news of his son George's death in
Cuba. He seemed encompassed and overwhelmed
by the misfortune, and walked the street as in a
heavy cloud of his own grief, forth from which he
extended his hand to meet my grasp. I expressed
my sympathy, which I told him I was now the
more capable of feeling in a father's suffering, as
being myself the father of a little girl&mdash;and, indeed,
the being a parent does give one the freedom
of a wider range of sorrow as well as happiness.
He again pressed my hand, and left me.</p>

<p>Well, dove, when I got to Salem, there was
great joy, as you may suppose. Our mother and
sisters take as much interest in little Una as can
possibly be desired. They think the lock of hair
very beautiful, and deny that it has the faintest
tinge of red. Mother hinted an apprehension
that poor baby would be spoilt&mdash;whereupon I
irreverently observed, that having spoilt her
own three children, it was natural for her to
suppose that all other parents would do the
same; when she knocked me into a cocked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
hat, by averring that it was impossible to
spoil such children as Elizabeth and me, because
she had never been able to do anything with
us. This I believe to be very true. There was
too much gentleness in her nature for such a task.
She remonstrates, by the by, against Una's being
carried about in anybody's arms, and says that it
will soon be impossible to keep her quiet in any
other way. This was the case with Elizabeth;
and mother never allowed her other children to
become habituated to it.</p>

<p>I could scarcely convince them that Una has begun
to smile so soon. It surprised even mother;
though her own children appear to have been
bright specimens of babyhood. Elizabeth could
walk and talk at nine months old. I do not understand
that thy husband was quite such a miracle
of precocity, but should think it not improbable,
inasmuch as precocious boys are said to make stupid
men.</p>

<p>Ownest wife, I long so much to get back to thee,
that it is a mockery to try to say how much. Yet I
think I shall be benefitted by the absence, though
it be truly an unpalatable medicine. I hope
thy father will be able to stay till Friday. It
is just possible, if I go out to see Longfellow, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
I may not come till Saturday night; but this will
depend partly on what day the steamer comes. I
shall consult thy mother about the necessity of thy
father's presence in Boston earlier than that.</p>

<p><i>Dearest Phoebe</i>,</p>

<p>I cannot let the day pass without speaking a
little word to thee, to tell thee how strange the old
Abbey seems without thy presence, and how
strange this life, when thou art away. Nevertheless,
I truly rejoice in thy absence, as hoping it will
do good to thy dearest brain, which has been over-wrought,
as well as thy physical frame. And how
does our belovedest little Una? whom I love more
than I ever told thee, though not more than thou
knowest&mdash;for is she not thine and mine, the symbol
of the one true union in the world, and of our
love in Paradise.</p>

<p>Dearest, my cook does his office admirably. He
prepared what I must acknowledge to be the best
dish of fried fish and potatoes for dinner to-day,
that I ever tasted in this house. I scarcely recognized
the fish of our own river. I make him get
all the dinners while I confine myself to the much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
lighter labors of breakfast and tea. He also
takes his turn at washing the dishes. Ellery
Channing came to see me this morning, and was
very gracious and sociable; and we went a fishing
together. He says his little girl weighed seven
pounds at her birth, and is doing very well. Miss
Prescott is now there.</p>

<p>We had a very pleasant dinner at Longfellow's;
and I liked Mrs. Longlady (as thou naughtily
nicknamest her) quite much. The dinner was
late, and we sate long; so that Conolly and I did
not get here till half-past nine o'clock&mdash;and truly
the old house seemed somewhat dark and desolate.
The next morning came George Prescott with
Una's lion, who greeted me very affectionately,
but whined and moaned as if he missed somebody
who should have been here. I am not quite as strict
as I should be in keeping him out of the house;
but I commiserate him and myself&mdash;for are we not
both of us bereaved. Still I am happy, and more
quiet than when thou wast here; because I feel it
to be good for thee to be there. Dearest, keep
thyself at peace, and do not let persons nor things
trouble thee; and let other people take all the care
of Una that is possible; and do not fear to go out
occasionally; and think sometimes of thy husband,
who loves thee unspeakably; and because he cannot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
tell its immensity, he may as well stop here,
especially as Conolly (whom I can no more keep
from smoking than I could the kitchen chimney)
has just come into the study with a cigar, which
might perfume this letter, and make thee think it
came from thy husband's own enormity.</p>

<p>Conolly is leaving me, to my unspeakable relief;
for he has had a bad cold, which caused him
to be much more troublesome, and less amusing,
than might otherwise have been the case. Thy
husband is in perfect health; and as happy in the
prospect of being alone, as he would be in anything,

<p>Thy two dearest letters have been received, and
gave me infinite comfort. Oh, keep thyself
quiet, best wife, and do not think of coming home
till thou art quite cured, even though Una should
grow to be quite a large girl in the interim. As
for me, I get along admirably, and am at this moment
superintending the corned beef, which has
been on the fire, as it appears to me, ever since the
beginning of time, and shows no symptom of being
done before the crack of doom. Mrs. Hale
says it must boil till it becomes tender; and so it
shall, if I can find wood to keep the fire a-going.
Meantime, I keep my station in the dining-room,
and read or write as composedly as in my own
study. Just now, there came a very important
rap to the front door; and I threw down a smoked
herring which I had begun to eat (as there is no
hope of the corned beef to-day) and went to admit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
the visitor. Who should it be but Ben, with
a very peculiar and mysterious grin upon his face!
He put into my hands a missive directed to "Mr.
and Mrs. Hawthorne"; it contained a little hit of
card signifying that "Dr. Lemuel Fuller and Miss
Catherine Barrett receive their friends Thursday
Eve, June 6th, at 8 o'clock." I am afraid I shall
be too busy washing my dishes, to pay many visits
during thy absence. This washing of dishes does
seem to me the most absurd and unsatisfactory
business that I ever undertook. If, when once
washed, they would remain clean forever and ever,
(which they ought in all reason to do, considering
how much trouble it is,) there would be less occasion
to grumble; but no sooner is it done, than it
requires to be done again. On the whole I have
come to the resolution not to use more than
one dish at each meal. However, I moralise
deeply on this and other matters, and have discovered
that all the trouble and affliction in the
world arises from the necessity of cleansing away
our earthly pollutions.</p>

<p>I ate the last morsel of bread, yesterday, and
congratulated myself on being now reduced to the
fag-end of necessity. Nothing worse can happen
(according to ordinary modes of thinking) than
to want bread; but, like most afflictions, it is worse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
in prospect than reality. I found one cracker in
the tureen, and exulted over it as if it had been so
much gold. However, I have sent a petition to
Mrs. Prescott, stating my destitute condition, and
imploring her succor; and till it arrives, I shall
keep myself alive on smoked herrings and apples,
together with part of a pint of milk, which I
share with Leo. He is my great trouble now,
though an excellent companion too. But it is not
easy to find food for him, unless I give him what
is fit for Christians&mdash;though, for that matter, he
appears to be as good a Christian as most laymen,
or even as some of the clergy. I fried some
pouts and eels, yesterday, on purpose for him; for
he does not like raw fish. They were very good;
but I should hardly have taken the trouble on my
own account.</p>

<p>George Prescott has just come to say, that Mrs.
Prescott has no bread at present, and is gone away
this afternoon, but that she will send me some tomorrow.
I mean to have a regular supply from
the same source&mdash;which thou shalt repay after thy
return.</p>

<p>I go to bed at dusk, now-a-days, out of a tender
consideration for the oil-can, which does not possess
the peculiar virtues of the Widow Cruse's.
[sic] Oh, dear little wife! Dost thou even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
think of me? I think of thee continually, and of
our darling Una, and long to see both thee and
her, yet not with an impatient and importunate
longing. I am too sure of my treasures not to be
able to bear a little separation of them, when it is
for thine own good. Thou needest be under no
uneasiness for my sake. Everything goes on well,
and I enjoy my solitude, next to thy society. I
suppose I shall write to Mr. Farley tomorrow,
but it would content me well to be quite alone till
thy return. Thou canst not imagine how much
the presence of Leo relieves the feeling of perfect
loneliness. He insists upon being in the room
with me all the time, (except at night, when he
sleeps in the shed) and I do not find myself severe
enough to drive him out. He accompanies me,
likewise, on all my walks, to the village and elsewhere;
and, in short, keeps at my heels all the
time, except when I go down cellar. Then he
stands at the head of the stairs and howls, as if he
never expected to see me again. He is evidently
impressed with the present solitude of our old
Abbey, both on his own account and mine, and
feels that he may assume a greater degree of intimacy
than would be otherwise allowable. He
will easily be brought within the old regulations,
after thy return.

<p>Ownest, I have written to-day, because I
thought thou wouldst be anxious to know what
sort of a life I lead, now that my guest has departed.
Thou wilt see that I am fit to be trusted in
my own keeping. No ghost has haunted me, and
no living thing has harmed me. God bless thee
and our little Una. I say to myself, when I feel
lonely, "I am a husband!&mdash;I am a father!"&mdash;and
it makes me so happy!</p>

<p>Thy letter was brought this morning by one of
the Fullers&mdash;which, I know not&mdash;but it was the
young man who called on us last winter; and he
promises to call and take this. Sweetest, if it
troubles thee to write, thou must not make the attempt.
Perhaps it is not good for thy head; and
thy mother can just say a word or two, to let me
know that all is going on well. Oh, keep thyself
quiet, dearest wife, and let not thy brain be
whirled round in the vortex of thy present whereabout;
else I must have thee back again as soon
as possible. But if it be for thy good, I can
spare thee at least a month longer; indeed, thou
must not come till the Doctor has both found out
thy disorder and cured it.</p>

<p>Everything goes on well with thy husband.
Thou knowest, at the time of writing my last letter,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
I was without bread. Well, just at supper
time came Mrs. Brown with a large covered dish,
which proved to contain a quantity of special good
slap jacks, piping hot, prepared, I suppose, by the
fair hands of Miss Martha or Miss Abby; for
Mrs. Prescott was not at home. They served me
both for supper and breakfast; and I thanked
Providence and the young ladies, and compared
myself to the prophet fed by ravens&mdash;though the
simile does rather more than justice to myself, and
not enough to the generous donors of the slap jacks.
The next morning, Mrs. Prescott herself brought
two big loaves of bread, which will last me a
week, unless I have some guests to provide for.
I have likewise found a hoard of crackers in one
of the covered dishes; so that the old castle is sufficiently
provisioned to stand a long siege. The
cornbeef is exquisitely done, and as tender as a
young lady's heart, all owing to my skilful cookery;
for I consulted Mrs. Hale at every step; and
precisely followed her directions. To say the
truth, I look upon it as such a masterpiece in its
way, that it seems irreverential to eat it; so perhaps
thou wilt find it almost entire at thy return.
Things on which so much thought and labor are
bestowed should surely be immortal.</p>

<p>Ellery Channing intends to make a tour presently.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
Wm. Fuller says he is at variance with
Miss Prescott&mdash;or at least is uncomfortable in the
house with her. What a gump! I have had
some idea of inviting him to stay here till thy return;
but really, on better consideration, the experiment
would be too hazardous. If he cannot
keep from quarrelling with his wife's nurse, he
would surely quarrel with me, alone in an empty
house; and perhaps the result might be a permanent
breach. On the whole, he is but little better
than an idiot. He should have been whipt often
and soundly in his boyhood; and as he escaped
such wholesome discipline then, it might be well
to bestow it now. But somebody else may take
him in hand; it is none of my business.</p>

<p>Leo and I attended divine services, this morning,
in a temple not made with hands. We went
to the farthest extremity of Peter's path, and
there lay together under an oak, on the verge of
the broad meadow. Dearest Phoebe, thou
shouldst have been there. Thy head would have
been quite restored by the delicious air, which was
too good and pure for anybody but thee to
breathe. Shouldst thou not walk out, every day,
round the common, at least, if not further? Thou
must not fear to leave Una occasionally. I shall
not love her, if she imprisons thee when thy health
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
requires thee to be abroad. Do not people offer
to take thee to ride?</p>

<p>I doubt whether Mr. Bradford could be comfortable
here, unless there were womankind in the
house to keep it in better order than it suits my
convenience to do. A man of his nice conscience
would be shocked, I suppose, if the whole house
were not swept, every day, from top to bottom,
or if the dishes of several meals were suffered to
accumulate, in order to save trouble by a general
cleansing. Now such enormities do not at all disturb
my composure. Besides, I find myself such
good company, and the hours flit so rapidly away,
that I have no time to bestow on anybody else.
Talk is but a waste of time. When I cannot be
with thee, mine ownest&mdash;my true life&mdash;then let
me be alone. I wrote to Mr. Farley, yesterday;
and am sorry for it, since I received thy letter.
But I presume there is no prospect of his coming;
and should he do so, I shall not hesitate to advise
him to go away, if our mode of life here
should seem unsuitable to his condition.</p>

<p>Darlingest wife, when thou writest next, tell
me if thou canst see the termination of thy absence;
but do not think it in the least necessary to
hurry on my account. I find I have shirts
enough for a fortnight or three weeks longer; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
can get somebody to wash them, at the end of that
time. Do not hurry thyself&mdash;do not be uneasy.
I had rather come and see thee in Boston, than
that thou shouldst return too soon.</p>

<p>Give my blessing to our daughter.</p>

<p>Mine ownest, ownest love, dost thou not want
to hear from thy husband? There is no telling
nor thinking how much I love thee; so we will
leave all that matter without another word.
Dearest, Mr. Farley arrived yesterday, and appeared
to be in most excellent health, and as
happy as the sunshine. Almost the first thing he
did was to wash the dishes; and he is really indefatigable
in the kitchen; so that thy husband is
quite a gentleman of leisure. Previous to his
coming, I had kindled no fire for four entire days,
and had lived all that time on the corned beef&mdash;except
one day, when Ellery and I went down the
river on a fishing excursion. Yesterday we boiled
some lamb, which we shall have cold for dinner
to-day. This morning, Mr. Farley fried a sumptuous
dish of eels for breakfast, and he avows his
determination to make me look fat before thy return.
Mrs. Prescott continues to be the instrument
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
of Providence, and yesterday sent us a very
nice plum-pudding. Thou seest, therefore, that
domestic matters are going on admirably. I have
told Mr. Farley that I shall be engaged in the forenoons,
and he is to arrange his own occupations
and amusements during that time. Thus, as
everything is so comfortably regulated, thou canst
stay in Boston without the slightest solicitude
about my welfare, as long as there is any object in
being near Dr. Wesselhoeft. But how our hearts
will rush together, when we meet again! Oh,
how I love thee!</p>

<p>Not much has happened of late. Leo, I regret
to say, has fallen under suspicion of a very grave
crime&mdash;nothing less than murder&mdash;a fowl crime it
may well be called&mdash;for it is the slaughter of one
of Mr. Hayward's hens. He has been seen to
chase the hens, several times, and the other day
one of them was found dead. Possibly he may
be innocent; and as there is nothing but circumstantial
evidence, it must be left with his own conscience.
Meantime, Mr. Hayward or somebody
else seems to have given him such a whipping,
that he is absolutely stiff, and walks about like a
rheumatic old gentleman. I am afraid, too, that
he is an incorrigible thief. Ellery Channing says
he saw him coming up the avenue with a whole
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
calf's head in his mouth. How he came by it, is
best known to Leo himself. If he were a dog of
fair character, it would be no more than charity
to conclude that he had either bought it or had it
given to him; but, with the other charges against
him, it inclines me to great distrust of his moral
principles. Be that as it may, he managed his
stock of provisions very thriftily&mdash;burying it in
the earth, and eating a portion of it whenever he
felt an appetite. If he insists upon living by
highway robbery, dost thou not think it would be
well to make him share his booty with us? Our
butcher's bill might thus be considerably lessened.</p>

<p>Miss Barret came a day or two ago to enquire
whether I thought my wife would be willing to
lend our astral lamp for the great occasion of this
evening. Thou seest, she has a very proper idea
of the authority of the wife, and cannot imagine
that I should venture to lend any article without
reference to thy wishes. As she pledged herself,
if there were any damages, to "make it good," I
took the liberty to put the lamp into her hands.
Thou knowest its trick of going out in the middle
of the evening; and it will be a truly laughable
and melancholy mishap, if it should suddenly
leave them in darkness, at the most critical moment.
Methinks it would be no favorable omen
for the prosperity of the marriage. Miss Catherine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
regrets very much that thou art not to be here,
this evening. I wonder thou dost not come on
purpose. By the by, it was not our old broken
astral lamp, but the solar lamp that I lent her.</p>

<p>Ownest wife, am I really a father?&mdash;the father
of thy child! Sometimes the thought comes to
me with such a mighty wonder that I cannot take
it in. I love our little Una a great deal better
than when I saw her last; and all the love that
grows within me for her, is so much added to the
infinite store of my love for thee. Ah, dost thou
think of me?&mdash;dost thou yearn for me?&mdash;does
thy breast heave and thy heart quake with love for
thy husband?&mdash;... (portion of letter missing)
I can hardly breathe for loving thee so
much.</p>

<p>Dearest, Mr. Farley is to carry this letter to the
Post-Office this morning, and perhaps he will find
a line or two from thee. If so, I shall be happy;
and if not, then too I shall be glad that thou hast
not tasked thy dearest little head to do any pen-work.</p>

<p><i>Only Belovedest</i>,</p>

<p>Thy letter came yesterday; and I suppose thou
didst get mine about the same time. Dearest, I
take it for granted that thou hast concluded to
await the arrival of the money from O'Sullivan;
so that I shall not expect thee till Friday or Saturday.
I think it is an excellent plan to have thy
mother come with thee; so pray ask her immediately,
if thou hast not done it already. I shall
not be able to send away Mr. Farley before thou
comest; but he will go on Monday.</p>

<p>Mr. Farley is in perfect health, and absolutely
in the seventh Heaven; and he talks, and talks,
and talks, and talks; and I listen, and listen, and
listen, with a patience for which (in spite of all
my sins) I firmly expect to be admitted to the
mansions of the blessed. And there is really a
contentment in being able to make the poor,
world-worn, hopeless, half-crazy man so entirely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
comfortable as he seems to be here. He is an admirable
cook. We had some roast veal and a
baked rice pudding on Sunday&mdash;really a fine dinner,
and cooked in better style than Mary can
equal; and George Curtis came to dine with us.
Like all male cooks, he is rather expensive, and
has a tendency to the consumption of eggs in his
various concoctions, which thou wouldst be apt to
oppose. However, we consume so much fish of
our own catching, that there is no great violation
of economy upon the whole. I have had my
dreams of splendor, but never expected to arrive
at the dignity of keeping a man-cook. At first,
we had three meals a day, but now only two.</p>

<p>We dined at Mr. Emerson's the other day, in
company with Mr. Hedge. Mr. Bradford has
been to see us two or three times. And, speaking
of him, do thou be most careful never to say a
word in depreciation of Sarah Stearns, in his presence.
Both of us (horrible to say!) have fallen
into this misfortune, on former occasions. Mr.
Farley has given me most unlooked for intelligence
in regard to him and her. He looks thinner
than ever&mdash;judge, then, how thin he must be&mdash;his
face is so thin, and his nose is so sharp, that
he might make a pen with it; and I wish he would
make me a better one than I am now writing with.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
He is particularly melancholy, and last Saturday,
when we were alone on the river together, seemed
half-inclined to tell me the why and wherefore.
But I desire no such secrets. Keep this to thy
little self.</p>

<p>I love thee, I love thee! Thou lovest me, thou
lovest me! Oh, I shiver again to think how much
I love thee&mdash;how much we love, and that thou art
soon, soon, coming back to thine own home&mdash;to
thine ownest husband; and with our beloved baby
in thine arms. Shall I know little Una, dost thou
think?</p>

<p>Now good bye, sweetest wife. It will be no
more than decent for me to go down and offer my
assistance to Mr. Farley in some of the minor
preparations of dinner. Thy mother must put
her skill in exercise; else he will find a sad
falling-off in our living, after thy return. I shall
look for thee partly on Friday, but shall not be
disappointed if thou comest not till Saturday.
God bless thee, thou belovedest.</p>

<p>I write this little note in order to warn thee in
due season that I shall not be at home till Monday.
Hillard has made an engagement for me
with Longfellow for Sunday; so that, without disappointing
both of those worthies exceedingly,
I cannot come away sooner. Belovedest,
I love thee a million times as much every
hour that I stay away from thee; and my
heart swells toward thee like a mighty flood.
Also, I have a yearning for our little Una;
and whenever I go, and with whomsoever I
am talking, the thought of thee and her is
ever present with me. God bless thee! What
a happy home we have. That is the knowledge
that I gain by staying away from thee.

<p><i>Dearest Phoebe Hawthorne</i>,
</p>

<p>Already an age has elapsed since I parted from
thee, mine own life; although, according to human
measurement, it is but about twenty-seven
hours. How I love thee, wife of my bosom!
There is no telling; so judge it by what is in thine
own deepest and widest little heart.</p>

<p>Sweetest, what became of that letter? Whose
fault was it, that it was left behind? I was almost
afraid to present myself before thy mother
without it. Nevertheless, the Count and I made
it our first business to call at 13 West-street,
where we found Madame Peabody (I will call
her so to please my Dove) in the book room alone.
She seemed quite as well as usual, and regretted, I
believe, that she had not gone to Concord&mdash;and
so did thy husband; but thou needest not say so
to the good old gentleman who sits looking at the
outside of this letter, while thou art reading the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
inside. I gave her all the information I could
about thy condition&mdash;being somewhat restrained,
however, by the presence of O'Sullivan.</p>

<p>Taking leave of thy mother, I went with the
Count to Mr. Bancroft's door, and then parted
with him, with some partial expectation of
meeting him again at dinner. Then I looked in
at the Athenaeum reading-room, and next went to
George Hillard's office. Who should I find here
but Longfellow, and with him Mr. Green, the Roman
consul, whom, as thou knowest, it was
Bridge's plan to eject from office for thy husband's
benefit. He has returned to this country
on a visit. Never didst thou see such an insignificant
looking personage (or person rather;)
and it surprised me so much the more, for I had
formed a high idea of his intellectual incarnation
from a bust by Crawford, at Longfellow's rooms.
Longfellow himself seems to have bloomed forth
and found solidity and substance since his marriage;&mdash;never
did I behold a man of happier aspect;
although I know one of happier fortunes incomparably.
But Longfellow appears perfectly
satisfied, and to be no more conscious of any
earthly or spiritual trouble than a sunflower is&mdash;of
which lovely blossom he, I know not why, reminded
me. Hillard looked better than I have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
ever before seen him, and was in high spirits on account
of the success of his oration. It seems to
have had truly triumphant success&mdash;superior to
that of any Phi Beta Kappa oration ever delivered.
It gladdened me most to see this melancholy
shadow of a man for once bathed and even
pervaded with a sunshine; and I must doubt
whether any literary success of my own ever gave
me so much pleasure. Outward triumphs are
necessary to him; to thy husband they are anything
but essential.</p>

<p>From Hillard's I went to see Colonel Hall, and
had a talk about politics and official matters; and
the good Colonel invited me to dinner; and I concluded
to accept, inasmuch as, by dining with the
Count, I should have been forced to encounter
Brownson&mdash;from whom the Lord deliver us.
These are the main incidents of the day; but I
did not leave Boston till half past five, by which
time I was quite wearied with the clatter and confusion
of the city, so unlike our quiet brooding
life at home. Oh, dear little Dove, thou shouldst
have been with me; and then all the quiet would
have been with me likewise.</p>

<p>Great was the surprise and joy of Louisa when
she found me at the door. I found them all
pretty well; but our poor mother seems to have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
grown older and thinner since I saw her at last.
They all inquired for thee with loving kindness.
Louisa intended to come and visit us in about a
week; and I shall not thwart her purpose, if it still
continue. She thinks she may be ready in a week
from to-day. And, dearest little wife, I fear that
thy husband will have to defer his return to thy
blessed arms till the same day. Longfellow
wants me to dine with him on Friday; and my
mother will not be content to give me up before
Thursday; and indeed it is not altogether unreasonable
that she should have me this long; because
she will not see me again.</p>

<p>But, sweetest Phoebe, thou knowest not how I
yearn for thee. Never hadst thou such love, as
now. Oh, dearest wife, take utmost care of thyself;
for if any harm should come to thee during
my absence, I should always impute blame to myself.
Do watch over my Dove, now that I am
away. And should my presence be needful before
Saturday, I will fly to thee at a moment's
warning. If all continue well, I shall proceed to
Boston on Thursday, visit Longfellow on Friday,
and come home (Oh, happiest thought!) on Saturday
night, with Louisa, if she finds it possible
to come. If anything should detain her, it will
be our mother's health. God bless thee. Amen.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span></p>

<p>Afternoon.&mdash;What a scrawl is the foregoing!
I wrote fast because I loved fervently. I shall
write once more before my return. Take care of
thy dearest little self and do not get weary.</p>

<p>It was revealed to me that thou didst write on
Saturday, and so, at nightfall, I went to the Post-Office,
but found no letter. This morning, it
has arrived, with the postmark of to-day. It
gladdens me to hear of Una's joy, and of thy being
with people whom thou knowest well, and
who know thee well, and with whom thou canst
have real intercourse and sympathy. As for us
in Castle Dismal, we miss thee greatly, all of us,
and dwell in a deeper shadow for lack of thee, and
that streak of living sunshine with which thou
hast illuminated the earth. Whom do I mean by
this brilliant simile? Can it be that little redheaded
personage? Louisa complains of the silence
of the house; and not all their innumerable
cats avail to comfort them in the least. Thy husband
thinks of thee when he ought to be scribbling
nonsense&mdash;and very empty and worthless is his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
daily life, without thee. Nevertheless, if thou
art at ease, do not come home in less than a week.
I feel as if it were good for thee to be there, and
good for Una too. Louisa told me, yesterday,
with some alarm in her manner, that Dr. Moss
(thy medical friend) says that the illness from
vaccination does not come on, or does not reach its
crisis, till the ninth day. Can this be so? And
will it be necessary to wait so long? That would
postpone thy return till the middle of next week&mdash;a
term to which I cannot yet reconcile myself.</p>

<p>I read Una's note, addressed to "Madame
Hawthorne," then sealed it up and threw it downstairs.
Doubtless, they find it a most interesting
communication; and I feel a little shamefaced
about meeting them.</p>

<p>I hear nothing from Washington as yet; nor,
indeed, is it yet time to expect any definite intelligence.
Meanwhile Pike and thy friend David
are planning to buy us an estate, and build a
house, and have even gone so far as to mark out the
ground-plot of the house, in chalk, on David's
hearth. I fear it will prove a castle in the air;
and yet, a moderate smile of Providence would
cause it to spring out of the earth, on that beautiful
hillside, like a flower in the summer time.
With a cottage of our own, and the surveyorship,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
how happy we might be!&mdash;happier than in Concord,
on many accounts. The Surveyorship I
think we shall have; but the cottage implies an
extra thousand or fifteen hundred dollars.</p>

<p>I have heard of Mr. Atherton's being in Boston
since thy departure;&mdash;whether Mrs. Atherton
is with him I know not. Governor Fairfield, I
understand, starts for Washington to-day.</p>

<p>God bless thee, dearest!&mdash;and blessed be our
daughter, whom I love next to thee! Again, if
thou feelest it good for thee, on any account, to
stay longer in Boston, do not hasten home;&mdash;but

<p><i>Intimatest Friend</i>,</p>

<p>I cannot settle down to work this forenoon, or
do anything but write to thee&mdash;nor even that, I
fear, with any good effect; for I am just as much
dissatisfied with this mode of intercourse as always
hitherto. It is a wretched mockery. But
then it <i>is</i> a semblance of communication, and,
thus far, better than nothing.</p>

<p>I got thy letter of Tuesday the same evening,
while it was still warm out of thy heart; and it
seemed to fill the air round about me with Nona's
prattle. I do love her&mdash;that is the truth,&mdash;and
almost feel it a pity to lose a single day of her development;&mdash;only
thou wilt tell me, by letter or
by mouth, all the pretty things that she says or
does, and more over find a beauty in them which
would escape my grosser perception. Thus, on
the whole, I shall be a gainer by our occasional
separations. Thee I miss, and without any recompense.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
I marvel how it is that some husbands
spend years and years away from their wives, and
then come home with perhaps a bag or two of
gold, earned by the sacrifice of all that life.
Even poverty is better&mdash;and in saying that, thou
knowest how much I say.</p>

<p>Nothing has happened here since I wrote thee
last. I suspect the intelligence of thy meditated
baby is very pleasant to the grandmother and
aunts; for Louisa met me at dinner, that day, with
unusual cheerfulness, and observed that Thanksgiving
was at hand, and that we must think of
preparing. [As] for me, I already love the future
little personage; and yet, somehow or other, I feel
a jealousy of him or her, on Una's account, and
should not choose to have the new baby better
than the old one. So take care what thou dost,
Phoebe Hawthorne! And now I think of it, do
not thou venture into that tremendous press and
squeeze, which always takes place on landing
from the ferry-boat at the East Boston depot.
Thou art not to be trusted in such a tumult; it will
be far better to wait behind, and compel the conductor
to find thee a seat. There is always the
densest squeeze on Saturdays.</p>

<p>But I shall not expect thee back on Saturday.
According to Dr. Wesselhoeft's dictum, and supposing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
the vaccination to have taken, that will be
precisely the critical day;&mdash;if Dr. Moss be correct,
the crisis comes on Monday. In either case, I
hope thou wilt wait a little. There is the greatest
satisfaction to me in thinking how comfortably
situated thou art, with thy sister at thy elbow,
and thy mother at arms' length, and thy Aesculapius
within a five minutes' summons. If I (and
thou too, thou lovingest one) could endure it, I
should be glad that thou mightest spend the winter
there; but that is too heart-chilling to think of&mdash;so
thou must even come back, in a few days
more, to old Castle Dismal! But I shall never
feel at home here with thee. I went, the other
afternoon, to look at the hill where Pike and the
Chancellor have built a castle in the air for our
reception. Thou hast no idea what capacities it
has.</p>

<p><i>Ownest Phoebe</i>,</p>

<p>The shoe arrived last evening; but on what evidence
thou dost so confidently accuse me of putting
it into the trunk, I cannot imagine. Thou
positively didst put it there thyself. I saw thee!</p>

<p>Dearest, if any money comes from New York
by to-day's mail, I will come to Boston on Thursday
morning, to escort thee home. Otherwise, I
really do not think I ought. Heaven knows, I
desire it; but as it is not necessary for thy safety,
and as we are so miserably poor, methinks the dollar
should be reserved for indispensables. I did
hope the New York money would have come to
hand before now. Providence must take our
matters in hand very speedily.</p>

<p>I hope, Phoebe, thou hast not engaged to pay
Winifred's passage, either to or from Boston. She
told Mrs. Dromedary that she should not have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
gone with thee, only that her passage would be
paid. She has a cousin living at the Essex House
in this city; and the Dromedary thinks she is
partly engaged to go there herself. This is the
secret of her willingness to remain in Salem. Dotish
as she appeared, she has wit enough to be fair
and false, like all her countryfolk. It will be
well to investigate this matter before thou returnest;
and, if she really means to leave us, perhaps
thou hadst better engage a new girl in Boston
forthwith.</p>

<p>Poor little Una's back&mdash;my heart bleeds for it.
Do not come back till it is well, nor till thou thyself
hast undergone thorough repairs, even though
thou shouldst be compelled to hire a lodging.</p>

<p>Ownest, be careful not to slip down. Thou
art prudent in behalf of other people, but hast
little caution on thine own account. In going to
the cars do not get entangled in that great rush of
people who throng out of the ferry-boat. Remain
behind, and Heaven will find thee a seat.
Would thou wast safe home again, eating thy potatoes,
and glancing sideways at me with thy look
of patient resignation. Never did I miss thee so
much as during this separation. But for the idea
of thee, my existence would be as cold and wintry
as the weather is now, and with a cloudy gloom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
besides, instead of the dazzling sunshine. I was
driven to play cards with Louisa, last evening!</p>

that can be said.</p>

<p>I have this moment received the packet and thy
letter, and cannot tolerate that thou shouldst not
have a word from thy husband tomorrow morning.
Truly, Castle Dismal has seemed darker
than ever, since I returned to it;&mdash;and not only
to me, but to its other inmates. Louisa spoke of
the awful stillness of the house, and said she
could not bear to give Una's old shoes to that
little Lines child, and was going to keep them
herself. I rejoiced her much, by telling her of
Una's home-sickness.</p>

<p>Fees were tolerably good, yesterday and to-day;
and I doubt we shall have enough to live on,
during thy continuance in Boston&mdash;for which let
us be thankful.</p>

<p>Bridge came to see me this afternoon, and says
Mary Pray has consented to come to thee; and by
this time, I hope, thou hast her. Thou canst not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
think what a peace I enjoy in the consideration
that thou art within reach of Dr. Wesselhoeft. It
is by my feelings as to thee and Una, more than
on my own account, that I find I am a true believer
in homeopathy.</p>

<p>Ownest, I love thee. I love little Una dearly
too. Tell her so, and show her the place, and
give her a kiss for me.</p>

Thou didst never see such an appetite.</p>

Thou dost not know how much I long to see thee
and our children. I never felt anything like it
before&mdash;it is too much to write about.</p>

<p>I do not think I can come on Monday before
10 ½, arriving in Boston at about 11. It is no

<p>Greatly needed by me were thy two letters; for
thou hadst never before been away from me so
long without writing. And thou art still busy,
every moment! I was in hopes thou wouldst
have a little quiet now, with Dora to take care of
the children;&mdash;but that seems fated never more to
be thine. As for me, I sink down into bottomless
depths of quiet:&mdash;never was such a quiet life as
mine is, in this voiceless house. Thank God, there
are echoes of voices in my heart, else I should die
of this marble silence. Yet I am happy, and,
dearest Phoebe, I wish that thou, likewise, couldst
now and then stand apart from thy lot, in the
same manner, and behold how fair it is. I think
we are very happy&mdash;a truth that is not always so
evident to me, until I step aside from our daily
life. How I love thee!&mdash;how I love our children!
Can it be that we are really parents!&mdash;that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
two beautiful lives have gushed out of our
life! I am now most sensible of the wonder, and
the mystery, and the happiness.</p>

<p>Sweetest wife, I have nothing to tell thee. My
life goes on as regularly as our kitchen clock. It
has no events, and therefore can have no history.</p>

<p>Well; when our children&mdash;these two, and three
or four more are grown up, and married off, thou
wilt have a little leisure, and mayst paint that
Grecian picture that used to haunt thy fancy. But
then our grandchildren&mdash;Una's children, and
Bundlebreech's,&mdash;will be coming upon the stage.
In short, after a woman has become a mother, she
may find rest in Heaven, but nowhere else.</p>

<p>This pen is so horrible that it impedes my
thought. I cannot write any more with it.
Dearest, stay as long as it is good for the children
and thyself. I have great joy in thinking how
good it has been for Una to have this change.
When thou comest back to me, it will be as the
coming of an angel, and with a cherub in each
hand. Indeed, it does not require absence and
distance to make an angel of thee; but the divine
qualities of the children do become somewhat
more apparent, by occasionally getting beyond
the reach of their clamor.</p>

<p>I think I had better not come on Saturday; but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
if thou wilt tell me the day of thy return, I will
come in the afternoon, and escort thee back. Poor
little Una! How will she bear to be caged up
here again. Give her a kiss for me, and tell her
I want to see her <i>very much</i>. I have been much
affected by a little shoe of hers, which I found on
the floor. Does Bundlebreech walk yet?</p>

<p>Thy letter has just come. I knew the day
would not pass over without one. Would that
my love could transform this ugly east wind into
the sweet south-west&mdash;then wouldst thou be full
of pleasant air and sunshine. I want to be near
thee, and rest thee.</p>

<p>Dearest, the things all arrived safe&mdash;not having
suffered even the dollar's worth of damage to
which the man restricted himself. The carpet
shall not be put down till thou comest. There is
no need of it, except to save thee the trouble.
We are in hopes of getting an elderly woman
(Hannah Lord, whom I think thou hast heard of)
for a handmaiden, but this is not so certain as I
could wish. Our mother and Louisa repugn at
the idea of an Irish girl; and there are scarcely any
others to be heard of. I should not wonder, after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
all, if we had to seek one in Boston. The usual
price here is $1.25. I trust we shall be provided
by the time thou art ready to come; but if
otherwise, Mrs. Campbell is now well, and can
officiate for a few days.</p>

<p>Duyckinck writes me that the African Cruise has
come to a second edition. It is also to be published
in a cheaper style, as one of the numbers of
a District School Library.</p>

<p>The weather is so bad that I hope thou wilt not
have gone to Horn pond to-day. How different
these east winds are from anything that we felt in
Concord. Nevertheless, I feel relieved at having
left that place of many anxieties, and believe that
we shall pass a happy winter here. All that I need
is to have shelter, and clothes, and daily bread,
for thee and Una, without the anguish of debt
pressing upon me continually;&mdash;and then I would
not change places with the most fortunate person
in the world. What a foolish sentence that is!
As if I would change places, in our worst estate,
either with man or angel.</p>

<p>Phoebe, I think I had better not come for thee
till Monday, as the weather is so unpropitious for
thy visits. If that be too soon, tell me; for thou
hadst better calculate on not seeing Boston again
for some months; and, that being the case, it will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
be advisable to act as if thou wast going to make
a voyage to Europe.</p>

<p>I find I shall love thee as thou never wast loved
before. God bless our little Una. She is our
daughter! What a miracle! I love mother and
child so much that I can put nothing into words.</p>

<p>I think I shall be diligent with my pen, in this
old chamber whence so many foolish stories have
gone forth to the world. I have already begun to
scribble something for Wiley &amp; Putnam.</p>

<p>I am altogether in favor of getting the six
chairs; as to the glass, I know not what to think.
In fact, I must leave all other articles to thy judgment,
and shall be satisfied, whatever thou dost.
We can dispense with the glass better than with
anything else. I rather covet the large marble-top
table; but perhaps the repairs would make it

<p>Una behaves (as thou wouldst affirm) like an

I bathed her this morning; and I believe she has
not shown the slightest wilfulness or waywardness,
since thy departure. We have very loving

<p>I received thy letter on Saturday evening, and
was more refreshed by it than if it had been a
draft of ice-water&mdash;a rather inapt comparison, by
the way. Thou canst have no imagination how
lonely our house is. The rooms seem twice as
large as before&mdash;and so awfully quiet! I wish,
sometime or other, thou wouldst let me take the
two children and go away for a few days, and
thou remain behind. Otherwise, thou canst have
no idea of what it is. I really am half afraid to
be alone, and feel shy about looking across the
dimly moon-lighted chamber. I expend a great
deal of sentiment as often as I chance to see any
garment of thine, in my rambles about the house,
or any of the children's playthings. And after
all, there is a strange bliss in being made sensible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
of the happiness of my customary life, by this
blank interval.</p>

<p>Tell my little daughter Una that her dolly,
since her departure, has been blooming like a rose&mdash;such
an intense bloom, indeed, that I rather
suspected her of making free with the brandy-bottle.
On taxing her with it, however, she
showed no signs of guilt or confusion; and I trust
it was owing merely to the hot weather. The
color has now subsided into quite a moderate tint,
and she looks splendidly at a proper distance;
though, on too close inspection, her skin appears
rather coarse&mdash;not altogether unlike that of thy
good Aunt B. She has contracted an unfortunate
habit of squinting; and her mouth, I am sorry
to say, is somewhat askew. I shall take her to
task on these matters, and hope to produce a reformation.
Should I fail, thou must take her in
hand. Give Una a kiss, and tell her I love her
dearly. The same to little Bundlebreech, who
has probably forgot "faver" by this time.</p>

<p>Dora complains terribly of lonesomeness, and
so does Aunty N. In short, we are pretty forlorn.
Nevertheless, I have much joy in your all being
in the country, and hope thou wilt stay as
long as thou feelest it to be for the best. How I
love the children!&mdash;how I love thee, best of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>

<p>Dearest Phoebe, when I saw thy thick letter,
last night, I could not imagine what might be its
contents, unless thou hadst sent a large package
of the precious roses, which I should have kissed
with great reverence and devotion. Thou wast
naughty not to do it. But the letter truly refreshed
my heart's thirst; and Una's also were
very delightful. What a queer epistle was that
which she dictated! It seemed as if she were
writing from Paradise to comfort me on earth.</p>

<p>Dearest, I long for thee as thou dost for me.
My love has increased infinitely since the last time
we were separated. I can hardly bear to think of
thy staying away yet weeks longer. I think of
thee all the time. The other night, I dreamed
that I was at Newton, in a room with thee, and
with several other people; and thou tookst occasion
to announce, that thou hadst now ceased to
be my wife, and hadst taken another husband.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
Thou madest this intelligence known with such
perfect composure and <i>sang froid</i>&mdash;not particularly
addressing me, but the company generally&mdash;that
it benumbed my thoughts and feelings, so
that I had nothing to say. Thou wast perfectly
decided, and I had only to submit without a word.
But, hereupon, thy sister Elizabeth, who was likewise
present, informed the company, that, in this
state of affairs, having ceased to be thy husband,
I of course became hers; and turning to me, very
coolly inquired whether she or I should write to
inform my mother of the new arrangement!
How the children were to be divided, I know not.
I only know that my heart suddenly broke loose,
and I began to expostulate with thee in an infinite
agony, in the midst of which I awoke; but the
sense of unspeakable injury and outrage hung
about me for a long time&mdash;and even yet it has not
quite departed. Thou shouldst not behave so,
when thou comest to me in dreams.</p>

<p>I had a letter from Bridge, yesterday, dated in
the latter part of April. He seems to be having
a very pleasant time with his wife; but I do not
understand that she is, as the Germans say, "of
good hope." In the beginning of the letter, he
says that Mrs. Bridge will return to America this
summer. In another part, he says that the ship
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
in which he is will probably return late in the autumn;
but he rather wishes that it may [be] delayed
till Spring, because Mrs. Bridge desires to
spend the winter in Italy.</p>

<p>Oh, Phoebe, I want thee much. My bosom
needs thy head upon it,&mdash;thou alone art essential.
Thou art the only person in the world that ever
was necessary to me. Other people have occasionally
been more or less agreeable; but I think I
was always more at ease alone than in anybody's
company, till I knew thee. And now I am only
myself when thou art within my reach. Thou
art an unspeakably beloved woman. How
couldst thou inflict such frozen agony upon me, in
that dream! Thou shouldst have caressed me
and embraced me.</p>

<p>But do not think, much as I want thee, that I
wish thee to come as long as thou judgest it good
for the children to be away, and as long as thou
thinkest we can afford the expense. We have a
pervading happiness, that goes on whether we are
present or absent in the body. Their happiness
depends upon time and place; and the difference
to them between town and country must be almost
that of a cage or the free air, to the birds. And
then it is so much better for their health.</p>

<p>Hast thou remembered to ask Mrs. Mann
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
whether little Pick Mann was named out of pure
gratitude and respect for the old refugee Colonel,
or whether there was not a little earthly alloy&mdash;an
idea of gilding an ugly name with a rich
legacy?</p>

<p>Ownest, if I write any more, it would be only to
try to express more lovings, and longings&mdash;and as
they are impossible to express, I may as well close.</p>

<p>Ownest, How long is it since I heard from thee&mdash;and
what an eternity since thou didst go away!
It seems at least as long as the whole time that we
have been married. My heart calls for thee, very
loudly, and thou comest not. And I want to hear
our children's voices;&mdash;it would be pleasant, even,
to see little Tornado in one of her tantrums. She
is a noble child. Kiss her and Bundlebreech for
me, and talk to them about me, lest I be entirely
forgotten.</p>

<p>If this had been a pleasant day, I should probably
have gone to New York on Custom-House
business; but it being thick and dismal, I shall
give up the expedition, although it would have
been a very favorable opportunity. I should
have been back here on Wednesday morning;
and as one of the intervening days is Sunday, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
another the Fourth of July, only a single day of
attendance at my office would have been lost.
Best of all, it would have cost nothing.</p>

<p>Dora has a great deal of work to do; but she
neglects nothing appertaining to my comfort.
Aunty 'Ouisa has favored me with one cup of
coffee, since thou wentest away, and with an occasional
doughnut; but I think thy lectures on
diet and regimen have produced a considerable
effect.</p>

<p>Dearest, is thy absence so nearly over that we
can now see light glimmering at the end of it?
Is it half over? If not, I really do not see how
I am to bear it. A month of non-existence is the
utmost limit&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>I am continually interrupted as I write, this
being pay-day, and a very busy time. I don't
know exactly what will be the amount of our
fees; but I should think it would be about as
good a month as the last. Thirty-five dollars,
however, have already been drawn for our quarter's
rent. If thou wantest any more money, as
probably thou dost, write me how much, and I
will send it. How much must I reserve to pay
Rebecca's wages? Any surplus, I intend to apply
in lessening Millet's bill.</p>

<p>Here comes somebody else.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span></p>

<p>Unspeakably belovedest, thy letter has just
been handed me, and I snatch a moment from
much press of business to say a word to thee. It
has made my heart heave like the sea, it is so tender
and sweet. Ah, thou hast my whole soul.
There is no thinking how much I love thee; and
how blessed thy love makes me. I wonder how
thou canst love me.</p>

<p>Thy letter was also most comfortable to me,
because it gives such a picture of thy life there
with the children. It seemed as if I could see
the whole family of my heart before my eyes,
and could hear you all talking together. I began
to be quite uneasy about little Bundlebreech's
indisposition, until thy latest intelligence
reassured me. Yet I shall be anxious to
hear again.</p>

<p>Dora could not come to Boston yesterday, to
meet Rebecca, because she has an infinity of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
work, and moreover, yesterday morning, she had
to go to bed with the tooth-ache.</p>

<p>I went to Boston to see the fireworks, and got
home between 11 &amp; 12 o'clock, last evening. I
went into the little room to put on my linen coat;
and, on my return into the sitting room, behold!
a stranger there&mdash;whom dost thou think it might
be?&mdash;it was Elizabeth! I did not wish to risk
frightening her away by anything like an exhibition
of wonder; and so we greeted one another
kindly and cordially, but with no more <i>empressement</i>
than if we were constantly in the habit of
meeting. It being so late, and I so tired, we did
not have much talk then; but she said she meant
to go to walk this afternoon, and asked me to go
with her&mdash;which I promised to do. Perhaps
she will now make it her habit to come down and
see us occasionally in the evening.</p>

<p>Oh, my love, my heart calls for thee so, that I
know not how to wait weeks longer for thee.
Yet I would not that thou shouldst deprive the
children of the beautiful country on that account.
All will be repaid us in the first hour of
meeting.</p>

<p>Own wife, the coat does not crock the shirtsleeve
in the least&mdash;so thy labor in lining it
would have been thrown away. I gave the vest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
to Louisa soon after thou wentest away, and have
seen nothing of it since.</p>

<p>I wish Una, and Julian too, would write a letter
to Aunty 'Ouisa. I know it would give her
as much pleasure as anything can.</p>

<p class="longsig">

<span class="i2">I</span> am <span class="smcap">Thine Ownest</span>.</p>

<p>Ownest, when thy letters come, I always feel
as if I could not have done without them a moment
longer. Thou must have received one
from me since the date of thine, but I hope it
will not weary thee to receive this brief scribblement.
If my hand would only answer to my
heart, what letters I should write thee! It is
wonderful&mdash;the growth of our love! Six years
ago, it seemed infinite; yet what was the love of
that epoch to the present! Thou badest me burn
two pages of thy last letter; but I cannot do it,
and will not; for never was a wife's deep, warm,
chaste love so well expressed, and it is as holy to
me as the Bible. Oh, I cannot begin to tell how
I love thee.</p>

<p>Dearest, I should not forgive myself if I were
to deprive the children of the country. Thou
must keep them there as long as thou canst.
When thou hast paid thy visit to Sarah Clark, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
must come and see thee in Boston, and if possible
(and if I shall be welcome) will spend a Sunday
there with thee.</p>

<p>There is no news. Miss Derby has finished
her picture, and it is now being publicly exhibited.
I have not yet seen it, but mean to go.</p>

<p>Mr. Pike is going to dine with me to-day, on
green peas.</p>

<p>Oh, for one kiss!</p>

<p>Dearest Phoebe, I enclose an advertisement of
silks. Aunty 'Ouisa would like to have you get
some patterns of those which she has marked
with a pencil.</p>

<p>A letter from Mrs. F. Shaw came for thee to-day;
and I opened and read it. It contains nothing
that requires thy immediate perusal; and as
it is rather bulky, I do not send it. She is well,
and so is Caroline Sturgis.</p>

<p>I hear great accounts of the canary birds, now

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
Were it not for Dr. Wesselhoeft, I should think
it best for thee to get away immediately.</p>

has little Bundlebreech wanted me?&mdash;and
dost thou thyself think of me with moderate
kindness? Oh, Phoebe, it is too great a sacrifice&mdash;this

<p>Belovedest, thy letter came yesterday, and
caused my heart to heave like an ocean. Thou
writest with a pen of celestial fire;&mdash;none ever
wrote such letters but thou&mdash;none is worthy to
read them but I&mdash;and I only because thou purifiest
and exaltest me by thy love. Angels, I
doubt not, are well pleased to look over thy shoulder
as thou writest. I verily believe that no
mortals, save ourselves, have ever known what
enjoyment was. How wonderful that to the
pure in spirit all earthly bliss is given in a measure
which the voluptuary never can have dreamed
of.</p>

<p>Soon&mdash;soon&mdash;thou wilt be at home. What
joy! I count the days, and almost the hours, already.
There is one good in our separation&mdash;that
it has enabled us to estimate whereabouts we
are, and what vast progress we have made into
the ever-extending infinite of love. Wherefore,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
this will not be a blank space, but a bright one,
in our recollection.</p>

<p>Dearest, I told Louisa of thy wish that she
should come on Saturday; and it seemed that the
proposal found favor in her eyes. If not, she
will perhaps commission thee to buy her a gown.</p>

<p>Elizabeth came down to see me last evening,
and we confabulated till eleven o'clock.</p>

<p>Dora is dying to see thee and the children.
The fortune teller has foretold that she is not to
marry poor Mr. Hooper, nor anybody else that
has been hitherto in question; but a young man,
who, Dora says, lives in Boston. She has thorough
faith in the prediction.</p>

<p>I forgot to take those two volumes of Cooper's
Miles Wallingford; and when I was last in Boston,
I looked for them on the shelf in vain. If
they may conveniently be had, when thou comest
home, wilt thou please to give thyself the trouble
of taking them.</p>

I must. Thou growest more and more absolutely

never knew how thou art intertwined with my

<p>Darlingest, thou hast mentioned Horace's

West-street, likewise, and reservest the reasons
till we meet. I wonder whether there be any connection

<p>I suppose thou wilt not expect (nor wish for) a
letter from me; but it is so desolate and lonesome
here that I needs must write. This is a miserable
time. Thy and the children's absence; and
this dreary bluster of the wind, which at once exasperates
and depresses me to the very last degree;
and finally, a breakfast (the repetition of
yesterday's) of pease and Indian pudding!! It
is a strange miscellany of grievances; but it does
my business&mdash;it makes me curse my day. This
matter of the breakfast is the most intolerable,
just at this moment; because the taste of it is still
in my mouth, and the nausea and disgust overwhelms
me like the consciousness of sin. Hell
is nothing else but eating pease and baked Indian
pudding! If thou lovest me, never let me see
either of them again. Keep such things for thy
and my worst enemies. Give thy husband bread,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
or cold potatoes; and he never will complain&mdash;but
pease and Indian pudding! God forgive me
for ever having burthened my conscience with
such abominations. They are the Unpardonable
Sin and the Intolerable Punishment, in one
and the same accursed spoonfull!</p>

<p>I think I hardly ever had such a dismal time
as yesterday. I cannot bear the loneliness of the
house. I need the sunshine of the children; even
their little quarrels and naughtinesses would be a
blessing to me. I need thee, above all, and find
myself, at every absence, so much the less able to
endure it. Come home come home!</p>

I almost feel as if I ought to come every day; but

seven; and the expense is so considerable. If

<p><i>Ownest wife</i>,</p>

<p>Thy letter (dated 22d, but postmarked this
very day) has just arrived, and perplexed me exceedingly
with its strange aspect. Thy poor
dear thumb! I am afraid it puts thee to unspeakable
pain and trouble, and I feel as if I
ought to be with thee; especially as Una is not
well. What is the matter?&mdash;anything except
her mouth? I almost wish thou hadst told me
to come back.</p>

<p>It rained so continually on the day of my departure
that I was not able to get over to the
Navy Yard, but had to put up at the Rockingham
House. Being recognized there, I was immediately
lugged into society, whether I would
or no; taking tea at one place, and spending the
evening at another. I have since dined out, and
been invited to a party&mdash;but escaped this latter
infliction. Bridge's house, however, is the quietest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
place imaginable, and I only wish thou
couldst be here, until our Lenox home is ready.
I long to see thee, and am sad for want of thee.
And thou too so comfortless in all that turmoil
and confusion!</p>

<p>I have been waiting for thee to write; else I
should have written before, though with nothing
to say to thee&mdash;save the unimportant fact that I
love thee better than ever before, and that I cannot
be at peace away from thee. Why has not
Dr. Wesselhoeft cured thy thumb? Thou never
must hereafter do any work whatever; thou wast
not made strong, and always sufferest tenfold
the value of thy activities. Thou didst much
amiss, to marry a husband who cannot keep thee
like a lady, as Bridge does his wife, and as I
should so delight to keep thee, doing only beautiful
things, and reposing in luxurious chairs, and
with servants to go and to come. Thou hast a
hard lot in life; and so have I that witness it,
and can do little or nothing to help thee. Again
I wish that thou hadst told me to come back; or,
at least, whether I should come or no. Four days
more will bring us to the first of May, which is
next Wednesday; and it was my purpose to return
then. Thou wilt get this letter, I suppose,
tomorrow morning, and, if desirable, might send
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
to me by express the same day; and I could leave
here on Monday morning. On looking at the
Pathfinder Guide, I find that a train leaves
Portsmouth for Boston at 5 o'clock P.M.
Shouldst thou send me a message by the 11
o'clock train, I might return and be with thee tomorrow
(Saturday) evening, before 8 o'clock. I
should come without being recalled; only that it
seems a sin to add another human being to the
multitudinous chaos of that house.</p>

<p>I cannot write. Thou hast our home and all
our interests about thee, and away from thee
there is only emptiness&mdash;so what have I to write
about?</p>

<p>I rec'd thy letter yesterday. I will be in Pittsfield
on <i>Thursday</i> next (a week from to-day)
and will escort thee home.</p>

<p>I have written quite a small volume of Julian's
daily life and mine; so that, on thy return,
thou wilt know everything that we have done
and suffered;&mdash;as to enjoyment, I don't remember
to have had any, during thy absence. It has
been all doing and suffering.</p>

<p>Thou sayest nothing whatever of Una.</p>

<p>Unless I receive further notice from thee I
shall consider Thursday the day. I shall go at
any rate, I think, rain or shine; but of course,
thou wilt not start in a settled rain. In that
case, I shall come again to Pittsfield, the next
day. But, if fair weather, I hope nothing will
detain thee; or if it necessarily must, and thou
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
has[t] previous knowledge of it, thou canst write
me.</p>

<p>Julian is perfectly well. We both, according
to our respective capacities, long for thee.</p>

<p>I wrote thee a note yesterday, and sent it to
the village by Cornelius; but as he may have neglected
to put it in, I write again. If thou wilt
start from West Newton on <i>Thursday</i> next, I
will meet thee at Pittsfield, which will answer
the same purpose as if I came all the way.</p>

<p>Mrs. Tappan requests that thou wilt bring ten
pounds of ground rice for her; or a less quantity,
if thou hast not room for so much.</p>

<p>Julian is very well, and keeps himself happy
from morning till night. I hope Una does the
same. Give my love to her.</p>

<p>I shall be most gladdest to see thee.</p>

thy note, in which thou speakest of deferring thy
return some days longer. Stay by all means as
long as may be needful. Julian gets along perfectly
well; and I am eager for thy coming only
because it is unpleasant to remain torn asunder.
Thou wilt write to tell me finally what day thou
decidest upon;&mdash;but unless I hear from thee, I
shall go to Pittsfield on <i>Saturday</i>, a week from
to-day. But if thou seest reason for staying
longer do so, that nothing may be left at loose
ends.</p>

<p>Julian and I had a fine ride yesterday with
Herman Melville and two other gentlemen.</p>

<p>Here I am as thou seest; and if not here, I
know not where I could be; for Boston is so full
that the Mayor has issued proclamation for the
inhabitants to throw open their doors. The
President is there.</p>

<p>They all appear to be well here; and thy
mother, if Horace and Georgia say truly, walked
three miles yesterday. I went with Mary to see
her, last evening, and found her much better
than I ever hoped.</p>

<p>Talking with Mary, last night, I explained
our troubles to her, and our wish to get
away from Lenox, and she renewed the
old proposition about our taking this house
for the winter. The great objection to it,
when first talked of, was, that we, or I, did not
wish to have the care and responsibility of your
father and mother. That is now removed. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
strikes me as one of those unexpected, but easy
and natural solutions wherewith Providence occasionally
unknots a seemingly inextricable difficulty.
If you agree with me, you had better notify
Mr. or Mrs. Sedgwick that we shall not
want the Kemble house. We can remain in the
red house till we come here.</p>

<p>We shall pay a rent, but I know not as yet
precisely what. But we shall probably only remain
half the time Mr. and Mrs. Mann are in
Washington.</p>

<p>Mary will write.</p>

<p>I shall probably go to Salem on Saturday.
Kiss and spank the children.</p>

<p>I arrived here in good condition Thursday
night at ½ past 12. Every moment of my time
has been so taken up with calls and engagements
that I really could not put pen to paper until
now, when I am writing before going down to
breakfast.</p>

<p>It is almost as difficult to see O'Sullivan here
as if he were a hundred miles off. I rode three
miles to his home on Friday, and found him not
at home. However, he came yesterday, and we
talked together until other people came between.</p>

<p>I do wish I could be let alone, to follow my own
ideas of what is agreeable. To-day, I am to dine
with a college-professor of mathematics, to meet
Miss Lynch!! Why did I ever leave thee, my
own dearest wife? Now, thou seest, I am to be
lynched.</p>

<p>We have an ugly storm here to-day. I intend
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
to leave New York for Philadelphia tomorrow,
and shall probably reach Washington on
Wednesday.</p>

<p>I am homesick for thee. The children, too,
seem very good and beautiful. I hope Una will
be very kind and sweet. As for Julian, let Ellen
make him a pandowdy. Does Rosebud still remember
me? It seems an age since I left home.</p>

It is very queer how much I have done for other

<p><i>Dearest Wife</i>,</p>

<p>We had the pleasantest passage, yesterday,
that can be conceived of. How strange, that
the best weather I have ever known should have
come to us on these English coasts!</p>

<p>I enclose some letters from the O'Sullivan's,
whereby you will see that they have come to a
true appreciation of Mr. Cecil's merits. They
say nothing of his departure; but I shall live in
daily terror of his arrival.</p>

<p>I hardly think it worth while for me to return
to the island, this summer;&mdash;that is, unless you
conclude to stay longer than a week from this
time. Do so, by all means, if you think the residence
will benefit either yourself or the children.
Or it would be easy to return thither, should it
seem desirable&mdash;or to go somewhere else. Tell
me what day you fix upon for leaving; and I will
either await you in person at the landing-place,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
or send Henry. Do not start, unless the weather
promises to be favorable, even though you should
be all ready to go on board.</p>

<p>I think you should give something to the servants&mdash;those
of them, at least, who have taken
any particular pains with you. Michael asked
me for something, but I told him that I should
probably be back again;&mdash;so you must pay him
my debts and your own too.</p>

<p>It is very lonesome at Rock Ferry, and I long
to have you all back again. Give my love to the

<p>I enclose a letter from thy brother N. It contains
one piece of intelligence very interesting to
the parties concerned.</p>

<p>Mr. O'Sullivan is going to London, this afternoon.
I wish thou wast at home, for the house
is very cheerless in its solitude. But it will be
only a few days before I see thee again; and
in the meantime thou must go to all accessible
places, and enjoy thyself for both of us. The
barometer goes backward to-day, and indicates a
proximate change of weather. What wilt thou
do in a rain-storm?</p>

<p>I am weighed down and disheartened by the

<p>I slept at Lancaster, last night, where I arrived
at 10 o'clock; and leaving at ½ past nine,
this morning, got here at twelve.</p>

<p>Since leaving you, I have been thinking that
we have skimmed the cream of the lakes, and perhaps
may as well go somewhere else, now. What
if you should come to Liverpool (that is, to Rock
Ferry Hotel) and spend a day or two, for the
sake of variety, and then go to Matlock or
Malvern, or wherever we may think best?
Should you conclude to do this, I think you had
better take a phaeton &amp; pair from Grasmere to
Windermere, and there you can get on the rail.
If you wish to stay longer at the lakes, however,
I shall be quite happy to come back. Mr. Wildeys
says that lodgings may be had reasonable
(and some at farmers' houses) in the vicinity of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
Bourness; but he does not know of any in particular.</p>

<p>Weigh these matters, and decide for yourself.
I have an impression, I hardly know why, that
we have done with the lakes for this year; but I
should not regret to have you stay longer.</p>

<p>I send the halves of a £10 &amp; of a £5.</p>

<p>There would be no difficulty in your coming
here without a male attendant.</p>

<p>Do not think that I wish you to come, contrary
to your opinion. If you and the children
are comfortable &amp; happy, I am quite content to
take another draught of the lakes.</p>

<p>Kiss them all.</p>

<p><i>Dearest wife</i>,</p>

<p>I received your letter a week ago, telling me
of your woeful passage and safe arrival. If I
had thought how much you were to suffer on the
voyage, I never could have consented to thy departure;
but I hope thou art now flourishing in
the southern sunshine, and I am sure it would
have been a dreadful matter for thee to remain
in such weather as we have lately had. But I do
so long to see thee! If it were not for Julian, I
do not think I could bear it at all. He is really
a great comfort and joy to me, and rather unexpectedly
so; for I must confess I wished to keep
him here on his own account and thine, much
more than on my own. We live together in
great love and harmony, the best friends in the
world. He has begun to go to dancing-school;
and I have heard of a drawing-master for him,
but do not yet let him take lessons, because they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
might interfere with his day-school, should we
conclude to send him thither. His health and
spirits seem now to be perfectly good; and I
think he is benefitted by a greater regularity of
eating than when at home. He never has anything
between meals, and seems not to want anything.
Mrs. Blodgett, Miss Williams, and their
niece, all take motherly care of him, combing his
wool, and seeing that he looks clean and gentlemanly
as a Consul's son ought to do. Since the
war-cloud has begun to darken over us, he insists
on buckling on his sword the moment he is
dressed, and never lays it aside till he is ready to
go to bed&mdash;after drawing it, and making blows
and thrusts at Miss Williams's tom-cat, for lack
of a better antagonist. I trust England and
America will have fought out their warfare before
his worship's beard begins to sprout; else he
will pester us by going forth to battle.</p>

<p>I crossed over to Rock Ferry, a few days ago;
and thou canst not imagine the disgust and horror
with which I greeted that abominable old pier.
The atmosphere of the river absolutely sawed me
asunder. If we had been wise enough to avoid
the river, I believe thou wouldst have found the
climate of England quite another thing; for
though we have had very bad weather for weeks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
past, the air of the town has nothing like the
malevolence of that of the river. Mrs. Hantress
is quite well, and inquires very affectionately
about thee, and the children, and Fanny. Mrs.
Watson crossed in the same boat with me. She
has taken a house at Cloughton, and was now going
over to deliver up the keys of the Rock Ferry
house. I forgot to inquire about Miss Sheppard,
and do not know whether she has succeeded
in letting our house.</p>

<p>I dined at Mr. Bright's on Thursday evening.
Of course, there were the usual expressions of interest
in thy welfare; and Annie desired to be remembered
to Una. Mr. Channing called on
me, a few days since. He has just brought his
family from Southport, where they have been
spending several weeks. Our conversation was
chiefly on the subject of the approaching war;
for there has suddenly come up a mysterious rumor
and ominous disturbance of all men's
spirits, as black and awful as a thunder-gust. So
far as I can ascertain, Mr. Buchanan considers
the aspect of affairs very serious indeed; and a
letter, said to be written with his privity, was
communicated to the Americans here, telling of
the breach of treaties, and a determination on
the part of the British Government to force us
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
into war. It will need no great force, however,
if the Yankees are half so patriotic at home, as
we on this side of the water. We hold the fate of
England in our hands, and it is time we crushed
her&mdash;blind, ridiculous, old lump of beef, sodden
in strong beer, that she is; not but what she has
still vitality enough to do us a good deal of mischief,
before we quite annihilate her.</p>

<p>At Mr. Bright's table, for the first time, I
heard the expression of a fear that the French alliance
was going to be ruinous to England, and
that Louis Napoleon was getting his arm too
closely about the neck of Britannia, insomuch
that the old lady will soon find herself short of
breath. I think so indeed! He is at the bottom
of these present commotions.</p>

<p>One good effect of a war would be, that I
should speedily be warned out of England, and
should betake myself to Lisbon. But how are we
to get home? Luckily, I don't care much about
getting home at all; and we will be cosmopolites,
and pitch our tent in any peaceable and pleasant
spot we can find, and perhaps get back to Concord
by the time our larch-trees have ten years'
growth. Dost thou like this prospect?</p>

<p>What a beautiful letter was thine! I do
think nobody else ever wrote such letters, so magically
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
descriptive and narrative. I have read it
over and over and over to myself, and aloud to
Julian, whose face shone as he listened. By-the-by,
I meant that he should have written a
letter to accompany this; but this is his dancing-school
day, and I did not bring him to the Consulate.
One packet of letters, intended for Lisbon,
has mysteriously vanished; and I cannot
imagine what has become of it, unless it were
slipt by mistake into Ticknor's letter-bag, and
so went to America by the last steamer. It contained
a letter from thy sister Elizabeth, one
from Julian, and myself, and, I believe, one
from Mr. Dixon.</p>

<p>Did you pay a bill (of between one or two
pounds) of Frisbie, Dyke &amp; Co.? I inquired
in my last about Mr. Weston's bill for coals.</p>

<p>Do not stint thyself on the score of expenses,
but live and dress and spend like a lady of station.
It is entirely reasonable and necessary
that thou shouldst. Send Una to whatever
schools, and let her take whatever lessons, thou
deemest good.</p>

<p>Kiss Una; kiss naughty little Rosebud. Give
my individual love to everybody.</p>

<p>P.S. Since writing the above, Mr. Channing
has been in, and thou wouldst be (as I am) at
once confounded and delighted to hear the warlike
tone in which he talks. He thinks that the
Government of England is trying to force us into
a war, and he says, in so many words, "LET
IT COME!!!" He is already considering how
he is to get home, and says that he feels ready to
enlist; and he breathes blood and vengeance
against whomsoever shall molest our shores.
Huzza! Huzza! I begin to feel warlike, too.
There was a rumor yesterday, that our minister
had demanded his passports; and I am mistaken
in Frank Pierce if Mr. Crampton has not already
been ejected from Washington.</p>

<p>No doubt O'Sullivan's despatches will enable
him to give thee more authentic intelligence than
I possess as to the real prospects.</p>

<p class="date"><i>Liverpool</i>, February 7<sup>th</sup>, 1856</p>

<p>Thy letter, my own most beloved, (dated
Jany. 31st) arrived yesterday, and revived me
at once out of a state of half-torpor, half misery&mdash;just
as much of each as could co-exist with the
other. Do not think that I am always in that
state; but one thing, dearest, I have been most
thoroughly taught by this separation&mdash;that is,
the absolute necessity of expression. I must tell
thee I love thee. I must be told that thou lovest
me. It must be said in words and symbolized
with caresses; or else, at last, imprisoned Love
will go frantic, and tear all to pieces the heart
that holds it. And the only other alternative is
to be torpid. I just manage to hold out from
one letter of thine to another; and then comes
life and joy again. Thou canst not conceive
what an effect yesterday's letter had on me. It
renewed my youth, and made my step lighter; it
absolutely gave me an appetite; and I went to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
bed joyfully to think of it. Oh, my wife, why
did God give thee to poor unworthy me! Art
thou sure that He made thee for me? Ah, thy
intuition must have been well-founded on this
point; because, otherwise, all through eternity,
thou wouldst carry my stain upon thee; and how
could thine own angel ever need thee then!
Thou art mine!&mdash;Thou <i>shalt</i> be mine! Thou
hast given thyself to me irredeemably. Thou
hast grown to me. Thou canst never get away.</p>

<p>Oh, my love, it is a desperate thing that I cannot
see thee this very instant. Dost thou ever
feel, at one and the same moment, the impossibility
of doing without me, and also the impossibility
of having me? I know not how it is that
my strong wishes do not bring thee here bodily,
while I am writing these words. One of the two
impossibilities must needs be overcome; and it
seems the strongest impossibility that thou
shouldst be anywhere else, when I need thee so
insufferably.</p>

<p>Well, my own wife, I have a little wreaked
myself now, and will go on more quietly with
what I have further to say. As regards O'Sullivan&mdash;(how
funny that thou shouldst put quotation
marks to this name, as if astonished at my
calling him so! Did we not entirely agree in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
thinking "John" an undue and undesirable familiarity?
But thou mayst call him "John," or
"Jack" either, as best suits thee.)&mdash;as regards
O'Sullivan, then, my present opinion of him is
precisely what thou thyself didst leave upon my
mind, in our discussions of his character. I have
often had a similar experience before, resulting
from thy criticism upon any views of mine.
Thou insensibly convertest me to thy own opinion,
and art afterwards surprised to find it so; in
fact, I seldom am aware of the change in my own
mind, until the subject chances to come up for
further discussion, and I find myself on what
was thy side.</p>

<p>But I will try to give my true idea of his character.
I know that he has most vivid affections&mdash;a
quick, womanly sensibility&mdash;a light and tender
grace, which, in happy circumstances, would
make all his deeds and demonstrations beautiful.
In respect to companionship, beyond all doubt,
he has never been in such fortunate circumstances
as during his present intercourse with
thee; and I am willing to allow that thou bringest
out his angelic part, and therefore canst not be
expected to see anything but an angel in him. It
has sometimes seemed to me that the lustre of his
angel-plumage has been a little dimmed&mdash;his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
heavenly garments a little soiled and bedraggled&mdash;by
the foul ways through which it has been his
fate to tread, and the foul companions with whom
necessity and politics have brought him acquainted.
But I had rather thou shouldst take <i>him</i> for a
friend than any other man I ever knew (unless,
perhaps, George Bradford, who can hardly be
reckoned a man at all,) because I think the Devil
has a smaller share in O'Sullivan than in other
bipeds who wear breeches. To do him justice,
he is miraculously pure and true, considering
what his outward life has been. Now, dearest,
I have a genuine affection for him, and a confidence
in his honor; and as respects his defects in
everything that concerns pecuniary matters, I believe
him to have kept his integrity intact to a degree
that is really wonderful, in spite of the embarrassments
of a lifetime. If we had his whole
life mapped out before us, I should probably
forgive him some things which thy severer sense
of right would condemn. Thou talkest of his
high principle; but that does not appear to me to
be his kind of moral endowment. Perhaps he
may have the material that principles are manufactured
from.</p>

<p>My beloved, he is not the man in whom I see
my ideal of a friend; not for his lack of principle,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
not for any ill-deeds or practical shortcomings
which I know of or suspect; not but what he
is amiable, loveable, fully capable of self-sacrifice,
utterly incapable of selfishness. The only
reason, that I can put into words, is, that he
never stirs me to any depth beneath my surface;
I like him, and enjoy his society, and he calls up,
I think, whatever small part of me is elegant and
agreeable; but neither of my best nor of my
worst has he ever, or could he ever, have a
glimpse. I should wish my friend of friends to
be a sterner and grimmer man than he; and it is
my opinion, sweetest wife, that the truest manly
delicacy is to be found in those stern, grim natures&mdash;a
little alpine flower, of tenderest texture,
and loveliest hue, and delicious fragrance,
springing out of a rocky soil in a high, breezy,
mountain atmosphere. O'Sullivan's quick, genial
soil produces an abundant growth of flowers,
but not just this precious little flower. He is too
much like a woman, without being a woman;
and between the two characters, he misses the
quintessential delicacy of both. There are some
tests of thorough refinement which, perhaps, he
could not stand. And yet I shall not dispute
that for refinement and delicacy he is one out of
a thousand; and we might spend a lifetime together
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
without putting him to a test too severe.
As for his sympathies, he would be always ready
to pour them out (not exactly like Niagara, but
like a copious garden-fountain) for those he
loved.</p>

<p>If thou thinkest I have done him great injustice
in the foregoing sketch, it is very probable
that thou wilt bring me over to thy way of thinking;
and perhaps balance matters by passing
over to mine.</p>

<p>Dearest, I do hope I shall next hear of thee
from Madeira; for this suspense is hard to bear.
Thou must not mind what I say to thee, in my
impatient agonies, about coming back. Whatever
can be borne, I shall find myself able to
bear, for the sake of restoring thee to health. I
have now groped so far through the thick darkness
that [a] little glimmer of light begins to appear
at the other end of the passage; it will grow
clearer and brighter continually, and at last it
will show me my dearest wife. I do hope thou
wilt find thy husband wiser and better than he
has been hitherto; wiser, in knowing the more adequately
what a treasure he has in thee; and better,
because I feel it such a shame to be loved by
thee without deserving it. Dost thou love me?</p>

<p>Give my love to Una, to whom I cannot write
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
now, without doubling the postage. Do not let
little Rosebud forget me. Remember me to Fanny,
and present my regards to Madame O'Sullivan,
and Mrs. Susan, and Miss Rodgers. So all is
said very properly.</p>

<p>Thou toldest me not to write to Madeira before
hearing from thee there; but I shall send
this to the care of the American Consul, to whom
I wrote by the last Lisbon steamer, sending the
letter to O'Sullivan's care. Thine own-ownest.</p>

<p>Julian is perfectly well.

<p class="date"><i>Liverpool</i>, March 18<sup>th</sup>, 1856</p>

<p>In a little while longer, ownest wife, we must
think about thy return to England. The
thought is a happiness greater than I can crowd
into my mind. Wilt thou think it best to go
back to Lisbon? This must depend, I suppose,
on the length of stay of the O'Sullivans in Madeira.
If they return to Lisbon before June,
thou wilt have to go with them; if they stay so
late as the first of June, I should think it best for
thee to come direct to Southampton; but I leave
it to thy decision, as thou canst weigh all the circumstances.
I somewhat dread thy returning to
this miserable island at all; for I fear, even if
Madeira quite rids thee of thy cough, England
will at once give it back. But Elizabeth has
sent thee a certain article which is vouched for,
by numerous certificates, as a certain cure for all
coughs and affections of the lungs. So far as I
can ascertain its structure, it consists of some layers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
of quilted flannel, covered with an oilcloth;
and the whole thing is not more than three inches
square. It is worn on the breast, next the skin,
and, being so small, it would not be perceptible
under the thinnest dress. In order to make it efficacious,
it is to be moistened with some liquor
from a bottle which accompanied it; and it keeps
the person comfortably warm, and appears to
operate like a charm, and makes a little Madeira
of its own about the wearer. If thou wast not
so very naughty&mdash;if thou wouldst consent to be
benefitted by anything but homeopathy&mdash;here in
this little box is health and joy for us!&mdash;yes, the
possibility of sitting down together in a mud-puddle,
or in the foggiest hole in England, and
being perfectly well and happy. Oh, mine ownest
love, I shall clap this little flannel talisman
upon thy dearest bosom, the moment thou dost
touch English soil. Every instant it shall be
shielded by the flannel. I have drawn the size
and thickness of it, above.</p>

<p>We are plodding on here, Julian and I, in the
same dull way. The old boy, however, is happy
enough; and I must not forget to tell thee that
Mary W. has taken him into her good graces,
and has quite thrown off another boy, who, Julian
says, has heretofore been her "adorer." I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
told Julian that he must expect to be cast aside
in favor of somebody else, by-and-bye. "Then
I shall tell her that I am very much ashamed of
her," said he. "No," I answered; "you must
bear it with a good grace and not let her know
that you are mortified." "But why shouldn't I
let her know it, if I <i>am</i> mortified?" asked he;
and really, on consideration, I thought there was
more dignity and self-respect in his view of the
case, than in mine; so I told him to act as he
thought right. But I don't think he will be
much hurt or mortified; for his feelings are marvellously
little interested, after all, and he sees
her character and criticises her with a shrewdness
that quite astonishes me. He is a wonderfully
observant boy; nothing escapes his notice; nothing,
hardly, deceives his judgment. His intellect
is certainly very remarkable, and it is almost a
miracle to see it combined with so warm and true
and simple a heart. But his heart admits very
few persons into it, large though it be. He is
not, I think, of a diffusive, but of a concentrative
tendency, both as regards mind and affections.</p>

<p>In Grace Greenwood's last "Little Pilgrim,"
there is a description of her new baby!!! in response
to numerous inquiries which, she says,
have been received from her subscribers. I wonder
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
she did not think it necessary to be brought
to bed in public, or, at least, in presence of a
committee of the subscribers. My dearest, I cannot
enough thank God, that, with a higher and
deeper intellect than any other woman, thou hast
never&mdash;forgive me the base idea!&mdash;never prostituted
thyself to the public, as that woman has,
and as a thousand others do. It does seem to me
to deprive women of all delicacy. Women are
too good for authorship, and that is the reason it
spoils them so.</p>

<p>The Queen of England is said to be going to
Lisbon, this summer; so perhaps thou wouldst
rather stay there and be introduced to her, than
come hither and be embraced by me&mdash;The O'Sullivans
would not miss seeing her, I suppose, for
all the husbands on earth. Dearest, I do not
like those three women very much; and, indeed,
they cannot be good and amiable, nor wise, since,
after living with thee for months, they have not
made thee feel that they value thee above all
things else. Neither am I satisfied with Mr.
Welsh's turning thee out of his house.</p>

<p>Mr. Dallas, our new Ambassador, arrived at
Liverpool a few days ago; and I had to be civil
to him and his son, and to at least five ladies
whom he brought with him. He seems to be a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
good old gentleman enough, and of venerable aspect;
but as regards ability, I should judge Mr.
Buchanan to be worth twenty of him. Dost thou
know that we are going to have a war? It is
now quite certain; and I hope I shall be ordered
out of the country in season to meet thee at Madeira.
Dost thou not believe me?</p>

<p>March 19th.&mdash;Ownest beloved, this morning
came thy letter of the 9th, by the African
steamer. I knew it could not be much longer delayed,
for my heart was getting intolerably hungry.
Oh, my wife, thou hast been so ill! And
thou art blown about the world, in the midst of
rain and whirlwind! It was a most foolish project
of O'Sullivan's (as all his projects are) to
lead thee from his comfortable fireside, to that
comfortless Madeira. And thou sayest, or Una
says, that the rainy season is just commencing
there, and that this month and the next are the
two worst months of the year! Thou <i>never</i>
again shalt go away anywhere without me. My
two arms shall be thy tropics, and my breast thy
equator; and from henceforth forever I will keep
thee a great deal too warm, so that thou shalt
cry out&mdash;"Do let me breathe the cool outward
air for a moment!" But I will not.</p>

<p>As regards teaching Julian French, I wish I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
had found a master for him when we first left
thee; but there seemed to be so many difficulties
in making him really and seriously study, without
companions, and without constant supervision,
that I let it alone, thinking that, on the continent,
all lost time would quickly be made up.
And now it will be so little while before thy return,
that I doubt whether much would be accomplished
in the meantime. It is very difficult
to get him really interested in any solitary study;
and as he could not take more than two lessons in
a week, and would have nobody to practise pronounciation
with, in the intervals, I think, the
result would be only an ineffectual commencement.
I have not myself the slightest tact or
ability in making him study, or in compelling
him to do anything that he is not inclined to do
of his own accord; and to tell thee the truth, he
has pretty much his own way in everything. At
least, such is my impression; but thou hast so
often told me of the strength of my will (of
which I am not in the least conscious) that it is
very possible I may have been ruling him with a
rod of iron, all the time. It is true, I have a sort
of inert and negative power, with which I should
strongly interpose to keep him out of mischief;
but I am always inclined to let him wander
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
around at his own sweet will, as long as the path
is a safe one. Thou hast incomparably greater
faculty of command than I have.</p>

<p>I think he must remain untaught till thou comest
back to take the helm. Thou wilt find him a
good and honest boy, healthy in mind, and
healthier in heart than when he left thee; ready
to begin his effectual education as soon as circumstances
will permit. Let this suffice. In
body, too, he never was better in his life than
now; and he is a real little rampant devil for
physical strength. I find it an arduous business,
now-a-days, to take him across my knee and
spank him; and unless I give up the attempt betimes,
he will soon be the spanker, and his poor
father the spankee.</p>

<p>I am going to dine at Mr. Bright's, this evening.
He has often besought me that Julian
might come and spend a few days at Sandheys;
and I think I shall let him go, and take the opportunity
to run up to London. What vicissitudes
of country and climate thou hast run
through, while I have never once stirred out of
this mud and fog of Liverpool! After returning
from London, and as Spring advances, I
mean to make little excursions of a day or two
with Julian.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span></p>

<p>Oh, dearest, dearest, interminably and infinitely
dearest&mdash;I don't know how to end that
ejaculation. The use of kisses and caresses is,
that they supersede language, and express what
there are no words for. I need them at this moment&mdash;need
to give them, &amp; to receive them.</p>

32, St. Anne's Place, <i>London</i>, April 7<sup>th</sup>, 1856</p>

<p>Best wife in the world, here I am in London;
for I found it quite impossible to draw any more
breath in that abominable Liverpool without allowing
myself a momentary escape into better
air. I could not take Julian with me; and so I
disposed of him, much to his own satisfaction,
first with the Brights, then with the Channings;
and I have now been here more than a week, and
shall remain till Thursday. The old boy writes
to me in the best of spirits; and I rather think he
can do without me better than I can without
him; for I really find I love him <i>a little</i>, and
that his society is one of my necessities, including,
as he does, thyself and everything else that I
love. Nevertheless, my time has been so much
occupied in London, that I have not been able to
brood over the miseries of heart-solitudes. They
have found me out, these London people, and I
believe I should have engagements for every day,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
and two or three a day, if I staid here through the
season. They thicken upon me, the longer I remain.
To-night, I am to dine with the Lord
Mayor, and shall have to make a speech!!
Good Heavens! I wish I might have been
spared this. Tomorrow night, I shall dine in the
House of Commons, with a member of Parliament,
in order to hear a debate. In short, I have
been lionized, and am still being lionized; and
this one experience will be quite sufficient for
me. I find it something between a botheration
and a satisfaction.</p>

<p>Oh, my dearest, I feel that my heart will be
very heavy, as soon as I get back to Liverpool;
for thy cough is not getting better, and our dear
little Rosebud has been ill! And I was not
there! And I do not know&mdash;and shall not know
for many days&mdash;what may have since happened
to her and thee! This is very hard to bear. We
ought never, never, to have separated. It is most
unnatural. It cannot be borne. How strange
that it <i>must</i> be borne!</p>

<p>Most beloved, I have sent down to Liverpool
for Elizabeth's talisman and medicine-bottles; for
Mr. Marsh is now in London, and perhaps he will
be able to take them to thee. I fear, however, that
they will not reach me in time to be delivered to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
him, and I shall be afraid to trust them to any but
a private conveyance. If they come, I hope thou
wilt give them a fair trial, at least, if the weather
still continues cold and wet. What a wretched
world we live in! Not one little nook or corner
where thou canst draw a wholesome breath! In
all our separation, I have never once felt so utterly
desperate as at this moment. I <i>cannot</i> bear it.</p>

<p>Everybody inquires about thee. I spent yesterday
(Sunday) at Mrs. S. C. Hall's country-seat,
and she was very affectionate in her inquiries, and
gave me this very sheet of paper on which I am
now writing&mdash;also some violets, which I have lost,
though I promised faithfully to send them to Madeira.
Dear me, I wish I had a little bit of sentiment!
Didst thou ever read any of her books?
She is a very good and kind person, and so is her
husband, though he besmeared me with such
sweetness of laudation, that I feel all over bestuck,
as after handling sweetmeats or molasses-candy.
There is a limit of decorum which ought not to be
over-stept.</p>

<p>I met Miss Cushman, on Saturday, in the
Strand, and she asked me to dinner, but I could
not go, being already engaged to meet another
actress! I have a strange run of luck as regards
actresses, having made friends with the three most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
prominent ones since I came to London, and I find
them all excellent people; and they all inquire for
thee!! Mrs. Bennoch, too, wishes to see thee very
much. Unless thou comest back in very vigorous
health, it will never do for us to take lodgings in
London for any considerable time, because it
would be impossible to keep quiet. Neither shall
I dare to have thee come back to Liverpool, accursed
place that it is! We will settle ourselves
in the South of England, until the autumn, and
then (unless Elizabeth's talisman works miracles)
we must be gone. The trip to Scotland, I fear,
must be quite given up. I suppose, as regards climate,
Scotland is only a more intensely disagreeable
England.</p>

<p>Oh, my wife, I do want thee so intolerably.
Nothing else is real, except the bond between thee
and me. The people around me are but shadows.
I am myself but a shadow, till thou takest me in
thy arms, and convertest me into substance. Till
thou comest back, I do but walk in a dream.</p>

<p>I think a great deal about poor little Rosebud,
and find that I loved her about ten million times
as much as I had any idea of. Really, dearest
wife, I have a heart, although, heretofore, thou
hast had great reason to doubt it. But it yearns,
and throbs, and burns with a hot fire, for thee, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
for the children that have grown out of our loves.
Una, too! I long unutterably to see her, and cannot
bear to think that she has been growing out of
her childhood, all the time, without my witnessing
each day's change. But the first moment, when
we meet again, will set everything right. Oh,
blessed moment!</p>

<p>Well, dearest, I must close now, and go in
search of Mr. Marsh, whom I have not yet been
able to see. God bless thee! I cannot see why
He has permitted so much rain, and such cold
winds, where thou art.</p>

<p class="longsig"><span class="smcap">Thine Ownest, Ownest.</span></p>

<p class="date"><i>Liverpool</i>, Novr. 24<sup>th</sup>, 1858</p>

<p><i>Dearest Wife</i>,</p>

<p>Your letter by the steamer of the 19th has come,
and has given me delight far beyond what I can
tell thee. There never were such letters in the
world as thine; but this, no doubt, I have already
told thee over and over. What pleasantly surprises
me is, that the beauty of thy hand-writing
has all come back, in these Lisbon letters, and they
seem precisely the same, in that respect, that my
little virgin Dove used to write me.</p>

<p>Before this reaches thee, thou wilt have received
the trunks by the Cintra, and also, the sad news
of the death of O'Sullivan's brother. I shall
wait with the utmost anxiety for thy next letter.
Do not thou sympathise too much. Thou art
wholly mine, and must not overburthen thyself
with anybody's grief&mdash;not even that of thy dearest
friend next to me. I wish I could be with
thee.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span></p>

<p>I am impatient for thee to be well. Thou
shouldst not trust wholly to the climate, but must
take medical advice&mdash;in Lisbon, if it is to be had&mdash;otherwise,
Dr. Wilkinson's. <i>Do</i> take cod-liver
oil. It is the only thing I ever really had any
faith in; and thou wilt not take it. Thou dost
confess to growing thin. Take cod-liver oil, and,
at all events, grow fat.</p>

<p>I suppose this calamity of the O'Sullivans will
quite shut them up from the world, at present.</p>

<p>Julian thrives, as usual. He has lately been
out to dine with a boy of about his own age, in
the neighborhood. His greatest daily grievance
is, that he is not allowed to have his dinner at
5½, with the rest of the family, but dines at one,
and sups alone at our dinner time. He never has
anything between meals, unless it be apples. I
believe I told thee, in my last, that I had give up
the thought of sending him to school, for the present.
It would be so great and hazardous a change,
in the whole system of his life, that I do not like to
risk it as long as he continues to do well. The intercourse
which he holds with the people of Mrs.
Blodgett's seems to me of a healthy kind. They
make a playmate of him, to a certain extent, but
do him no mischief; whereas, the best set of boys
in the world would infallibly bring him harm as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
well as good. His manners improve, and I do not
at all despair of seeing him grow up a gentleman.
It is singular how completely all his affections of
the head have disappeared;&mdash;and that, too, without
any prescriptions from Dr. Dryasdust. I encourage
him to make complaints of his health,
rather than the contrary; but he always declares
himself quite well. The difficulty heretofore has
been, I think, that he had grown morbid for want
of a wider sphere.</p>

<p>Miss Williams is very unwell, and, for the last
two or three days, has had several visits from the
Doctor;&mdash;being confined to her bed, and in great
pain. I don't know what her disorder is; but she
is excessively nervous, and is made ill by anything
that agitates her. The rumor of war with America
confined her for several days.</p>

<p>Give my most affectionate regards to the O'Sullivans.
I never felt half so grateful to anybody,
as I do to them, for the care they take of thee. It
would make a summer climate of Nova Zembla,
to say nothing of Lisbon.</p>

<p>This despatch for O'Sullivan has just reached
me; and I do not know whether there will be time
to send it by the steamer that sails to-day.</p>

<p>Your letters, written immediately after the receipt
of the sad news, did not reach me till yesterday;
while those by the Southampton steamer,
written afterwards, arrived here days ago. Those
Liverpool steamers are not nearly such safe mediums
as those by Southampton; and no letters of
importance ought to be trusted to them.</p>

<p>Mrs. Blodgett will buy the articles required by
Mrs. O'Sullivan, and likewise the soap for you,
and have them in readiness for the next Liverpool
steamer.</p>

<p>We are quite well (Julian and I) and as contented
as we can expect to be, among strangers,
and in a continual cold fog. I have heard no private
news from America, since I wrote last.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span></p>

<p>I have not a moment's time to write Una; but
kiss her for me, and Rosebud too. Neither can I
tell thee, in this little moment, how infinitely I
love thee.</p>

<p class="date"><i>Liverpool</i>, Decr. 13<sup>th</sup>, 1858</p>

<p><i>Dearest</i>,</p>

<p>I wrote thee a brief note by a steamer from this
port on the 11th, with O'Sullivan's despatches.
Nothing noteworthy has happened since; and nothing
can happen in this dawdling<a name="FNanchor_A" id="FNanchor_A" href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> life of ours. The
best thing about our Liverpool days is, that they
are very short; it is hardly morning, before night
comes again. Una says that the weather in Lisbon
is very cold. So it is here&mdash;that searching,
spiteful cold that creeps all through one's miserable
flesh; and if I had to cross the river, as last
winter, I do believe I should drown myself in despair.
Nevertheless, Julian and I are in excellent
condition, though the old boy often grumbles&mdash;"It
is very cold, papa!"&mdash;as he takes his morning
bath.</p>

<p>The other day, speaking of his first advent into
this world, Julian said, "I don't remember how I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
came down from Heaven; but I'm very glad I
happened to tumble into so good a family!" He
was serious in this; and it is certainly very queer,
that, at nearly ten years old, he should still accept
literally our first explanation of how he came to
be among us.</p>

<p>Thy friend John O'Hara still vagabondises
about the street; at least, I met him, some time
since, with a basket of apples on his arm, very
comfortably clad and looking taller than of yore.
I gave him an eleemosynary sixpence, as he told
me he was getting on pretty well. Yesterday, his
abominable mother laid siege to my office during
the greater part of the day, pretending to have
business with me. I refused to see her; and she
then told Mr. Wilding that her husband was gone
to Ireland, and that John was staying at Rock
Ferry with Mrs. Woodward, or whatever the
lady's name may be, and that she herself had no
means of support. But I remained as obdurate as
a paving-stone, knowing that, if I yielded this
once, she would expect me to supply her with the
means of keeping drunk as long as I stay in Liverpool.
She hung about the office till dusk, but finally
raised the siege.</p>

<p>Julian looks like a real boy now; for Mrs. Blodgett
has his hair cut at intervals of a month or so,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
and though I thought his aspect very absurd, at
first, yet I have come to approve it rather than
otherwise. The good lady does what she can to
keep his hands clean, and his nails in proper condition&mdash;for
which he is not as grateful as he
should be. There is to be a ball at his dancing-school,
next week, at which the boys are to wear
jackets and white pantaloons; and I have commissioned
Miss Maria to get our old gentleman
equipped in a proper manner. It is funny how
he gives his mighty mind to this business of dancing,
and even dreams, as he assured me, about
quadrilles. His master has praised him a good
deal, and advanced him to a place among his
elder scholars. When the time comes for Julian
to study in good earnest, I perceive that this feeling
of emulation will raise his steam to a prodigious
height. In drawing (having no competitors)
he does not apply himself so earnestly as to the
Terpsichorean science; yet he succeeds so well
that, last night, I mistook a sketch of his for one
of his master's. Mrs. Blodgett and the ladies
think his progress quite wonderful; the master
says, rather coolly, that he has a very tolerable eye
for form.</p>

<p>Una seems to be taking rapid strides towards
womanhood. I shall not see her a child again;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
that stage has passed like a dream&mdash;a dream merging
into another dream. If Providence had not
done it, as thou sayest, I should deeply regret her
having been present at this recent grief-time of the
O'Sullivans. It did not seem to me that she
needed experiences of that kind; for life has never
been light and joyous to her. Her letters make
me smile, and sigh, too; they are such letters as a
girl of fifteen would write, with a vein of sentiment
continually cropping up, as the geologists
say, through the surface. Then the religious tone
startles me a little. Would it be well&mdash;(perhaps
it would, I really don't know)&mdash;for religion to be
intimately connected, in her mind, with forms and
ceremonials, and sanctified places of worship?
Shall the whole sky be the dome of her cathedral?&mdash;or
must she compress the Deity into a narrow
space, for the purpose of getting at him more readily?
Wouldst thou like to have her follow Aunt
Lou and Miss Rodgers into that musty old Church
of England? This looks very probable to me;
but thou wilt know best how it is, and likewise
whether it had better be so, or not. If it is natural
for Una to remain within those tenets, she
will be happiest there; but if her moral and intellectual
development should compel her hereafter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
to break from them, it would be with the more
painful wrench for having once accepted them.</p>

<p>December 14th.&mdash;Friday.&mdash;O'Sullivan desires
me to send American newspapers. I shall send
some with the parcel by the Liverpool steamer of
the 21st; and likewise through John Miller, whenever
I have any late ones; but the English Post
Office does not recognize American newspapers as
being newspapers at all, and will not forward
them except for letter postage. This would be
ruinous, considering that the rate for single letters,
between here and Lisbon, is a shilling and sixpence;
and a bundle of newspapers, at a similar
rate, would cost several pounds. I <i>won't</i> do it.</p>

<p>Miss Williams has not yet left her chamber.
Her illness was very serious, and Mrs. Blodgett
was greatly alarmed about her; but I believe she
is now hopefully convalescent.</p>

<p>Julian is outgrowing all the clothes he has, and
is tightening terribly in best sack, and absolutely
bursting through his trousers. No doubt thou
wouldst blaspheme at his appearance; but all boys
are the awkwardest and unbeautifullest creatures
whom God has made. I don't know that he
looks any worse than the rest. I have given Mrs.
Blodgett the fullest liberty to get him whatever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
she thinks best. He ought to look like a gentleman's
son, for the ladies of our family like to have
him with them as their cavalier and protector,
when they go a-shopping. It amazes me to see the
unabashed front with which he goes into society.</p>

<p>I have done my best, in the foregoing scribble,
to put thee in possession of the outward circumstances
of our position. It is a very dull life; but
I live it hopefully, because thou (my true life)
will be restored to me by-and-by. If I had known
what thou wouldst have to suffer, through thy
sympathies, I would not for the world have sent
thee to Lisbon; but we were in a strait, and I knew
no other way. Take care of thyself for my sake.
Remember me affectionately to the O'Sullivans.</p>

<p><i>Dearest</i>,</p>

<p>Una must be tired of the monotony of receiving
letters from me; and perhaps thou wilt be willing
to relieve her, just for once. Her letter, and Julian's,
and Rosebud's, all three gave me great pleasure;
and I was particularly astonished at the old
boy's learned epistle&mdash;so learned, indeed, that it
cost me some study to comprehend it. He is certainly
a promising lad, and I wish I could answer
his letter in Hebrew.</p>

<p>Affairs succeed each other so fast, that I have
really forgotten what I did yesterday. I remember
seeing Henry Bright, and listening to a stream
of babble from his lips, as we strolled in the Park
and along the Strand. Today, I have breakfasted
with Fields, and met, among other people,
Mr. Field Talfourd, who promises to send thee a
photograph of his portrait of Mr. Browning. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
was very agreeable, and seemed delighted to see
me again. At lunch, we had Lady Dufferin,
Mrs. Norton, and Mrs. Sterling, author of the
Cloister Life of Charles V., with whom we are to
dine on Sunday. Thou wouldst be stricken dumb
to see how quietly I accept a whole string of invitations,
and, what is more, perform my engagements
without a murmur.</p>

<p>A little German artist has come to me with a
letter of introduction, and a request that I will sit
to him for a portrait in bas-relief. To this, likewise,
I have consented!!!&mdash;Subject to the condition
that I shall have my leisure.</p>

<p>Mr. Fields has given me, for thee, The Idylls
of the King&mdash;not the American, but the English
edition.</p>

<p>I have had time to see Bennoch only once. If
I go to Canterbury at all, it must be after my
visit to Cambridge; and in that case, I shall have
to defer my return till the 31st of May. I cannot
yet tell how it will be.</p>

<p>The stir of this London life, somehow or other,
has done me a wonderful deal of good, and I feel
better than for months past. This is queer, for,
if I had my choice, I should leave undone almost
all the things I do.</p>

<p>I have bought a large Alpaca umbrella, costing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
nine shillings. Probably I shall mislay it before
my return.</p>

<p>I trust thou dost not burthen thyself with
cares. Do drive about, and see Bath, and make
thyself jolly with thy glass of wine.</p>

<p>Remembrances to Fanny, and love to great and
small.</p>

<p><i>Dearest wife</i>,</p>

<p>This is a very ugly morning, and, I am afraid,
will keep Julian and me at home. The old gentleman
had planned a fishing expedition and will
probably insist upon it pretty strenuously, in spite
of the imminent danger of rain. He seems insatiable
in his love of the sea, and regrets that we
have but a day or two more to stay, as much as I
rejoice of it.</p>

<p>Thou dost insist too strongly upon the inconveniences
and discomforts of our present abode.
I rather need to have the good side of our condition
presented to me than the bad one&mdash;being sufficiently
prompt in discovering the latter for myself;
and this is true in almost all cases. I first
look at matters in their darkest aspect, and having
satisfied myself with that, I begin gradually
to be consoled, to take into account the advantages
of the case, and thus trudge on, in my heavy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
way, but with the light brightening around me.
Now, while this process is going on, methinks it
would be more advisable to assist the benigner influence
than to range thyself on the side of the sinister
demon, and assure me that I am suffering a
thousand inconveniences, of which I am beginning
to be unconscious.</p>

<p>I doubt whether I could have been more comfortable
anywhere else than here. The people of
the house are very worthy souls, both of them, entirely
unobtrusive, doing everything they can for
us, and evidently anxious to give us the worth of
our money&mdash;and kindly disposed, moreover, beyond
money's worth. We live better than I care
about living, and so well that Julian dreads the
return to the simple fare of the Wayside. The
vicinity is very beautiful&mdash;insomuch that if I had
seen it sooner, I doubt whether I should have built
my tower in Concord&mdash;but somewhere among
these noble woods of white pine and near these
rocks and beaches. In fact, were it not for the
neighborhood of the railway, the site of this little
black house would be an excellent one; for the
wood is within half a minute's walk, and the shore
may be reached in ten minutes. Well;&mdash;our
sleeping accommodations are poor;&mdash;that is not
to [be] denied, but leaving out that matter, we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
have nothing to complain of&mdash;except the heat,
which would have pervaded any abode, unless it
were an Italian palace.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dana (the elder poet's wife, I believe)
called here in a barouche the other day, while Julian
and I were out, to see Una, whom she sup[posed]
to be stopping here? She had two or
three young ladies with her, and would probably
have asked Una to make a visit at their villa.</p>

<p>Elizabeth came to see us, Tuesday afternoon,
and brought some more books. I proposed that
she should take advantage of our escort to Concord;
but she says she cannot be ready before the
first week of September.</p>

<p>It is time we were gone from hence; for everybody
seems to have found us out, and Julian says
the boys shout at him from the cliffs, crying "Mr.
Hawthorne! Mr. Hawthorne!!" I don't know
whether they mistake him for his father, or pay
him these courteous attentions on his own account.</p>

<p>You may await tea for us on Saturday&mdash;unless
the old people chance to be very hungry.</p>

<p>Julian did not finish his letter; but I suppose
thou wilt be glad to receive it, such as it is. It
rains again most horribly to-day; so that I have
been obliged to leave him at home, where he
finds society enough and the greatest kindness. I
believe I told you, in one of my former letters,
that he has quite left off hunching his shoulders.
He has complained of the headache, now and
then, but not often; and Dr. Dryasdust has promised
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
to take him in hand, and entirely refit him&mdash;that
is, if he prove to be out of repair.</p>

<p>I hoped to have received letters from thee by

having left Lisbon on the 15th. She reports
the Madrid as having arrived on the Friday after
sailing. I long to know whether thy cough yet
begins to be benefitted by the sunshine, and whether
thou findest again the elasticity of frame and
spirit, which thou leftest behind in America.
Since thou hast departed, I sometimes feel a
strange yearning for the Wayside, and wish that
our wanderings were over, and all of us happy together

<p>Wishing to spend a little while in New York,
we did not leave there till 2 o'clock, yesterday,
and so are not yet in Washington. I had a pleasant
time in New York, and went on Friday evening,
by invitation, to the Century Club, where I
met various artists and literary people. The next
forenoon, Ticknor strolled round among his acquaintances,
taking me with him. Nothing remarkable
happened, save that my poor old bedevilled
phizmahogany was seized upon and photographed
for a stereoscope; and as far as I could
judge from the negative, it threatens to be fearfully
like.</p>

<p>The weather here is very warm and pleasant;
there are no traces of snow and it seems like the
latter end of April. I feel perfectly well, and
have a great appetite. The farther we go, the
deeper grows the rumble and grumble of the coming
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>

waiting our arrival to begin.</p>

<p>We expect to leave Philadelphia at 8¼ tomorrow

<p>I have been particularly well yesterday and to-day.
You must particularly thank Mr. Fields for
the two volumes of the magazine. The article
about Lichfield and Uttoxeter is done; and I shall
set about the remaining article for the magazine
in a day or two, and probably get it finished by

<p>I want a new hat, my present one being too

might be kind enough to get me one at his hatter's.
I have measured my old hat round outside
of the hatband, and it is about 24 inches; inside,
it measures 7 inches one way, and a little
more than 8 the other, and is hardly large enough.

dined on potatoes and squash, as usual. I did
purpose indulging myself in a plate of hot soup;
but thy exhortations were so earnest that I gave
up the idea, and am doubtless the better for my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
abstinence&mdash;though I do not as yet see that the
country has profited thereby.</p>

<p>Mr. Wetherbie came to see me with his bill;
but I informed him of thy orders not to pay it
without some subtraction, and told him he must
await thy return&mdash;which he seemed not unwilling
to do. He is going to the wars!&mdash;as a dragoon!!&mdash;for
he says he has all his life been fond of military
service, and the captain of his troop is an
"old military associate." Thou wouldst have
thought, to hear him talk, that this gallant Wetherbie
was a veteran of at least twenty campaigns;
but I believe the real motive of his valiant impulses
consists in his having nothing else to do,
and in his being dazzled by the sight of $200 in
gold, which W. brought home&mdash;where he could
have got it (unless by robbing the dead) I can't
imagine; for his wages for three months would
not have been more than $40. But really, dearest,
the spirit of the people must be flagging terribly,
when a sick old man like Wetherbie is accepted
as a bold dragoon! It shows that good
soldiers cannot be had.</p>

<p>Julian has had his hair cut according to his own
notions; so thou must expect to see a scarecrow.</p>

<p>Do not thou come home on Wednesday, if it
can do any good either to thyself or Bab to stay
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
longer. But thou hast still another expedition to
make, and the cold weather will soon be upon us.
Kiss Bab for me and believe me</p>
